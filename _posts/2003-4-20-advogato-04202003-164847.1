As reported by <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/118048_tf118x.html
">Seattle PI</a>, <a href="http://www.billboard.com/bb/daily/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1868047">BillBoard</a> and <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1471321/20030416/madonna.jhtml">MTV</a>, P2P networks are being flooded by short clips of Madonna <a href="http://www.waxy.org/archive/2003/04/14/madonnas.shtml">saying</a> &quot;What the f*ck do you think you are doing?&quot;.  These fans are being greeted with silence and <a href="http://www.waxy.org/random/audio/Madonna - What The Fuck.mp3">this small personal message</a>. I guess Madonna feels that these people aren't fans looking for a taste of Madonna's new album. She would rather disappoint them, by having them buy her album, only to discover that they just paid for ten filler tracks in addition the one or two they enjoy. Madonna doesn't want them to  use P2P Networks to find out if the album is actually worth buying. They need to find an alternative method of discovering new music, online listening booths are much different then those at your local music store. What ever happened to being able to sample music in the comfort of your own home?

Meanwhile, the message is a great new sample that can be remixed into new <a href="http://www.digitalcutuplounge.com/audio_video/Digital_Cutup_Lounge_vs_Madonna-What_The_Fuck.mp3">tracks</a>.
Now since this willfully got put online by the artist, do we have to worry about copyrights in regards to this message?

Thanks to a few crackers, the fans could have  <a href="http://www.curlio.com/new_showarticle.php?id=3899">gotten the MP3s</a> from Madonna.com. It displayed links to MP3s of her new album entitled <a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/music/artist.jsp?name=032103_madonna&amp;page=1">American  Life</a>.
