Looks like <a href="http://www.cdfreaks.com/document.php3?Doc=48&amp;Page=1">someone</a> has spend more time looking into the
new Music CD Copy protection that got launched by the
majors. Playing with the error protection bits is something
I could have seen coming, but didn't really think people
would have actually gone for it. Bummer.

TheStandard has been posting a lot of news/articles on online music. Gotta find more time to read them all.
