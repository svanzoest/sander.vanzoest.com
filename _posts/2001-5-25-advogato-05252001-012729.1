          <b>Universal's Plan to conquer the media world</b>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>
I found <a href="http://public.wsj.com/sn/y/SB990655409508091533.html">this
article</a> with a rough vision of Universals plans. It
reminds me
a lot of the <a href="http://www.fair.org/media-woes/corporate.html">Media
Monopoly</a> that has been discussed over the years and has
been
portrait in many articles, movies and books (media!?!). ;-)

I haven't heard anything about the <a href="/person/highgeek/diary.html?start=31">Courtney
Love</a> trial. It would be very
interesting to see how that is going.

          <b>Work</b>
        </p>
        <p>
It has been pretty slow and akward lately. I am not really
sure what to think of it all. I have been trying to get
stuff done, but it is hard to motivate myself under these
conditions. I have been trying to dive back into music to
keep myself from going nuts over this stuff.

          <b>Product Warranty</b>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>
It is really hard for me to tell if buying something that is
pretty expensive and top of the line is going to be
something better to get then something mediocre that doesn't
have such a big drain in my wallet. Most of the time though,
buying something that is entry level or average tends to not
work or barely work good enough for
it to be of any use or provide a benefit.

        <p/>
        <p>The more I look at
it just
about everything has a warranty that states you should have
no
manufactoring defects for X amount of time. But what about
the
fact that most things manufactored have a really short
product  <a href="http://www.replicant.net/">life
span</a>. So you spend the extra money so you would have
something useful, but then it looks like that roughly when
the
warranty has worn off it breaks and you have to buy a new
one anyways.

        <p/>
        <p>Things aren't build to last forever anymore.
Maybe this
is something that I still have in me from having grown up in
Europe, but things just seem to fall apart after barely any
use. The only way to have it last longer  is if you make it
a full time job to
maintain it and take care of it like it is the most precious
jewel you have ever seen. So you get frustrated if you spend
money on the
low end and it doesn't have enough features to be remotely
useful.
Or you spend an arm and a leg on something and so it can be
depreciated, replaced or simply be rendered useless after a
very
short time. Frustrating I tell you!</p>
