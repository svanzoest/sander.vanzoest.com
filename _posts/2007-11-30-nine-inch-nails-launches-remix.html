Trent decided to launch the site <a href="http://sander.vanzoest.com/2007/11/trent_reznor_on_copyright_and.html">anyways</a>. See <a href="http://remix.nin.com/">remix.nin.com</a>. As described in the <a href="http://remix.nin.com/faq/">FAQ</a>on the site, every upload will be scanned for infringing material, as we originally did at MP3.com.

<ul>
<li>Q: Why doesn't my uploaded remix show up on the site immediately?</li>
<li>A: Unfortunately, we are at the mercy of frustrating record company legal politics, and must ensure that your mix does not include any unauthorized material - as defined in the next answer on this page - before it is approved for the site. Approving every mix is a tedious process, and we rely on the greatly-appreciated help of the site moderators to review submitted mixes. Because of this, it may take some time before your mix shows up on the site. You will receive an email when it becomes available - in the meantime, please be patient, and understand this isn't the way we'd run the site if we had a choice.
</li>
<li>Q: What kind of materials are not okay to include in my remix?</li>
<li>A: Thanks to the record company copyright politics mentioned in the answer above, we must require that your mix does not contain ANY elements of copyrighted material, unless you yourself own the copyright (i.e. it's your own music). Your mix can include any element of any NIN song, or of other songs offered in multitrack format on this site. You can manipulate or destroy those pieces as much as you'd like, and you can combine them with your own original sounds and music. You CANNOT include samples of songs by other artists, or samples from movies, TV shows, or video games. Any remixes containing these elements will be rejected during the approval process. Please understand that it is not our wish to impose these restrictions on your creativity or the functionality of this site, but we have no choice in the matter.

</ul>

It is unfortunate that you have to do this, especially since it is hard for individuals to know what is copyrighted material and what is in the public domain. It certainly seems to highlight that the DMCA is not the right answer here.
