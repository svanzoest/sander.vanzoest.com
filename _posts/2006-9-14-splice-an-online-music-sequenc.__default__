We have seen a lot of online media applications lately, but none have really struck my musical chord as <a href="http://www.splicemusic.com/">Splice</a> has. 

What is it? It is an early version of an online music creation community. Think of it as a very basic sequencer tied to a social community for sharing music and samples all licensed under <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>.

Now this is something I can get excited about. I mean <a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/blog/2006/06/online_video_ed.html">Online Video Editing</a> is nice, but this online music sequencing is something I can loose hours playing with. It could use some more high quality, filters, effects and samples in addition to the ones from <a href="http://www.ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> and the <a href="http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/">Free Sound Project</a> and you'll be able to create a new track without ever needing to have any gear, music software or studio time. You do not even need hard drive space to store the tracks.

I am not exactly sure what their business model is. Is it advertising, white label licensing/hosting, charging for samples? Who knows, better read their <a href="http://www.splicemusic.com/tou/">terms of use</a>.

Check out this nice <a href="http://www.splicemusic.com/music/antti/progressive+theme+v5">progressive theme v5</a> by <a href="http://www.splicemusic.com/user/antti">antti</a>. I also like the fact that it drops you right into the sequencer with all the settings enabled. That makes it very easy to make a remix and it also allows you to easily learn from how others use the software. It is one of the things that I really liked when <a href="http://www.nin.com/">Nine Inch Nails</a> released <a href="http://www.nin.com/access/only/protools/">sequenced tracks for ProTools</a> for people to play with. I had a similar track, I think it was for <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/">Reason</a>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Clouser">Charlie Clouser</a> that was just amazing.

I created an <a href="http://www.splicemusic.com/user/svanzoest">account</a>, but I have not had any time to create anything. Hopefully in due time. ;-) Enjoy and please let me know what you come up with. I'd love to check it out.
