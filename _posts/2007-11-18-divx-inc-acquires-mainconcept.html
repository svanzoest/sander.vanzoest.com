Recently DivX, Inc. announced it was acquiring codec developer MainConcept AG. MainConcept strategy of ‘Every Codec, Every Platform’ is to port its video codecs to many new platforms which perfectly aligns with DivX and its certification programs.

MainConcept along with Elecard have been big strides in the AVC world that work very well in the streaming and low bitrate plays. This is highlighted by Adobe's licensing of MainConcepts AVC/AAC decoders for use in Flash 9.
