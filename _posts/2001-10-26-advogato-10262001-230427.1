          <b>Life</b>
        </p>
        <p>
 It has been a while, but I guess I have been busy 
enjoying my time off and doing all sorts of stuff, not 
necessarily computer related.

</p>
        <p>
I had a few trips to Universal Studios, Legoland 
California and to
South Baja California, Mexico for some surfing in
freezing water. Overall a very good time to get away
from things and ponder some more on the current 
happenings and goals in life. I find it good to do that
every once in a while, just to keep on top of why you are 
doing what you are doing. It was good to hang out with
old friends as well talking what all has happened in the 
last few years.

On the computer front I have been hacking on 
MusicBrainz and MacOS X.1 and reading random
things that find my interest. Not much in detail really,
just reading up on mailing lists and writting random 
scripts and programs to make life on MacOS X a little 
easier. I did some minor consulting 
work, but found I wasn't really what I looking to do right 
now. Although, I must say it was a fun bunch of people 
to work with.

          <b>Media</b>
        </p>
        <p>
With all this time, I have been reading a lot of things,
listening to some new music and watching a lot of 
movies. Maybe  I will post about that under my alter ego 
one of these days.
