Since saturday evening, San Diego has been dealing with some significant fires that started from the east. Most highways, schools and businesses are closed today. They area where I <a href="http://www.torreypine.org/">live</a> and <a href="http://www.divxnetworks.com/">work</a> isn't directly effected, but it is raining ashes and the sunlight is severely discoloring the landscape in <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/gallery/">surreal yellow hues</a>. I mirrored an <a href="https://sander.vanzoest.com/graphics/fires/aerial01.html">Aerial Shot</a> and a <a href="https://sander.vanzoest.com/graphics/fires/sdcountymap.html">County Map</a> from <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/">SignOn San Diego</a> that give you a better overview of the fires. The only site that I have found that does online video coverage was <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/">NBC San Diego</a>.
