I have been spending more time with audio effects and
different
codecs and building my music database today. I read an
<a href="http://www.digit-life.com/articles/oggvslame/">interesting
article</a> that compares LAME encoded MP3s with Ogg Vorbis.
vorbis now as an RTP Payload draft with some pretty useful
APIs
under decent licensing, I might have to convert everything I
own
into that, but that would mean re-encoding everything which
would take forever. On the other hand, I will be able to
have all
the source code and APIs available to manipulate it forever
for
personal use, which makes me the boss over my own &quot;backups&quot;.
