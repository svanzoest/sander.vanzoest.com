<a href="http://mayhem-chaos.net/blog/archives/000231.html">Robert Kaye</a> of <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> fame points us to a great new project named <a href="http://www.magnetbox.com/riaa/search.asp">RIAA Radar</a>. It allows you to search for an artist or album and it will provide you with a best guess as to whether the item is affiliated with the <a href="http://www.riaa.org/">RIAA</a>. Now you can check, before you buy some music, if you will be contributing to RIAA's cause or not. Very handy.
