I currently get the greatest pleasures of learning how the
installation procedure works on the Microsoft Windows
platform. I guess there are still people who want our software
to install smoothly and run on this excitingly confusing
platform. It is definately interesting, but the last thing I
want is people to realize that I am understanding this and
they might get the bright idea that maybe I should work on
this for a long time. No thanks! So, yes, I am learning the
Installer SDK.

I am getting to do all sorts of different things ranging
from a little XML work (the reason I actually got hired),
build and install environment hacking, performance tuning,
network architecture and research on things such as
Audio/Video. I really just wish I could continue hacking on
XML and I18N issues. I will have to find time in after work
hours for the real fun stuff.

This Tuesday I will be at Covalent's Headquarters in San
Francisco for some meeting and most likely will try to stay
the entire week, so I can hit up some clubs on the weekend
and see Darren Emmerson at <a href="http://www.spundae.com/">Nikita</a> and Anthony Pappa
at <a href="http://www.looq.com/parties/redsquare.htm">Red
Square</a> in <a href="/person/jwz/">jwz</a>' newly opened <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/">DNA Lounge</a>. If you are
up in SF during the week and want to meet up, let me know.
It is going to be interesting to be working from the office
again, I am not sure if that is going to be productive or
counter productive. We will find out I guess.</p>
