My brother pointed me to a nifty <a href="http://www.honda.co.uk/newcars/accord300k.html">Honda Ad</a> [<a href="http://home.attbi.com/~bernhard36/honda-ad.html">large mirror</a>] which apparently took <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F13%2Fnhonda13.xml">606 takes</a> to put together. It reminds me of when we would setup dominos around the house with all sorts of little bridges, see-saws and flippers. It was a game of patience and luck. It was always sad to think that someone could open the front door and cause the cold winter wind to come in and blow it all down. We were practicing for a chance to attend <a href="http://www.dominodomain.com/">Domino Day</a>. If you like the ad, you might also enjoy <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0094300">Der Lauf der Dinge (The Way Things Go)</a> by Peter Fischli and David Weiss.
