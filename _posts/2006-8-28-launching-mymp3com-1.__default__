Earlier this month, a friend and ex-coworker <a href="http://eyespot.com/blogs/kevlar">Kevin Baird</a> posted a video of the my.mp3.com service launch on the evening of 11 Jan 2000. This launch had lots of <a href="http://www.ipra.org/library/docs/gwa1150.htm">PR</a> and was what eventually brought on the <a href="http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/09/06/mp3_universal/">lawsuits</a> that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMG_v._MP3.com">forced the company to be sold to Vivendi Universal</a>.

The my.mp3.com development was a long stretch and a lot of work went into making that launch happen. 

Recently, I experienced the launch of <a href="http://stage6.divx.com/">Stage6</a> at <a href="http://www.divx.com/">DivX</a> and although there was no where near such a large crowd at the office at the time of launch. It did remind me a lot of the my.MP3.com launch days.

Enjoy this great historical video. Thanks a million, Kevin!

The above movie is hosted by <a href="http://www.eyespot.com/">Eyespot</a>, which was <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051118/news_lz1b18mp3.html">founded</a> by none other then another MP3.com alumni, David Dudas. 

Ideally, I could download a copy and save people the bandwidth of streaming this each time they load this page, but I did not find an easy way to do this. Please be respectful of the bandwidth, since I know that <a href="http://blog.forret.com/2006/05/youtube-bandwidth-terabytes-per-day/">hosting videos is not cheap</a>.
