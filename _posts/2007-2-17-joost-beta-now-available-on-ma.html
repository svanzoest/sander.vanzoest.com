And now the moment a lot of you have been waiting for. Joost Beta is now available for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">MacOS X</a> on Intel. If you are a current beta tester, but was not able to check it out because you only had a mac. Now is your chance.

This also means, I no longer have to reboot to Windows. Yeah! :)
