          <b>Online Journals and Diaries</b>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>
Well, this week I found out that public diaries and 
journals aren't always a good thing. People tend to 
missread or interpret what is written and hold it against 
you. Regardless of how hard you try to make 
something succesfull or try to create the best you 
mention a single word in your diary and it all comes out 
like you do nothing at all.

</p>
        <p/>
        <p>
Add telecommuting to the puzzle and life becomes 
even more unpredictable. I can see diaries like these 
become an issue when you discuss trade secrets or 
explain how easy it would be to by pass security, but 
even simply stating what you do on  a particular 
weekend or things 
you care about can be taken the wrong way.

I said it once and I will say it again, politics only 
provides a way for the most expressive people to gain a 
voice that could ultimately undermine everything you 
have done.

          <b>O'Reilly Open Source Conference in San Diego</b>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>
I spend a few hours last week at this conference and I 
must say it was great to be able to run into soo many 
people you haven't seen for a while at the same time. it 
is like having a reunion, except this time it was in my 
home town. I also saw a few people from my old 
stomping grounds such as <i>tommy</i>, <i>bmd</i>, 
<i>scottb</i> and 
<a href="/person/geekd/">geekd</a>. 

</p>
        <p/>
        <p>
I met a few new people have been getting active on the 
Apache front. And this occasion also allowed to show 
some friends one of the better mexican restaurants in 
old town. It was good to finally meet  people such as 
<a href="/person/ask/">ask</a> with whom I have talked many 
times online, but never ran into in person.

</p>
        <p/>
        <p>
I mainly was there to be able to give some people rides 
and go to a few meetings, since certain 
people such as <a href="/person/dirkx/">dirkx</a>, 
<a href="/person/rbb/">rbb</a> and <i>dougm</i> 
where in 
town for the
conference.

          <b>Peer 2 Peer</b>
        </p>
        <p>
This movement is really taking all the hype it can get 
and moving forward. This totally reminds me of what 
started the MP3 movement. Many companies such as 
LimeWire, Kazaa, Edonkey and San Diego's <a href="http://www.firstpeer.com/">FirstPeer</a> are taking a 
stab at the market. It all sounds very interesting 
technology wise, but I find it hard to see how you would 
make any money at it, which is good for a pay check, 
but ultimately why most people start companies 
anyways.

          <b>MacOS X</b>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>I am getting really close to getting my MacOS X 
machine to be what I ultimately look for in a client OS. 
Of course having my normal Macintosh programs work 
such as ProTools and other audio software would be 
ideal, but I guess it will still take a while. I really need to 
spend some time looking at the Audio API. Thanks to
<a href="http://mrcla.com/xonx/">XonX</a>, <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a>  I now have 
enlightenment 16.5 running on MacOS X next to my 
Omniweb browser windows. A few hours hacking on 
the weekend and boom! Look at what you get. It is 
funny though as many people have told me that soo 
many open source people are starting to run a 
proprietary OS on their desktop/laptop. Pretty odd, but I 
guess you run what solves all your needs and MacOS X 
is definately the closest OS from what I can tell.
