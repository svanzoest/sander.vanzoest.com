        <b>Big Five</b>
        <p>
This is a bit old but looks like <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/updates/lat_love010228.htm">Courtney
Love</a> is at it again. Fighting for fair rights for
musicians around the world. This is like <i>money</i> versus
<i>a *lot* of money</i>. I wish her all the best and I am
happy to see
some take the stand. Go Courtney!

          <b>San Francisco</b>
        </p>
        <p>
I will be up in San Francisco again next week. Doing the
work thing
and finding some time to hang out with random folks
including
friends from the office. Should be a challenging but good
time.
