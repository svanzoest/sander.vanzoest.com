An old co-worker of mine, Brian Dear,
<a href="http://www.brianstorms.com/archives/000716.html">points us</a> to an old blade runner documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281011/">"On the Edge of 'Blade Runner'"</a> created in 2000 for British television that has recently appeared on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3807826142091223684">Google Video</a>. It is worth a look if you have never seen it.
