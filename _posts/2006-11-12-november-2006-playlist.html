I have had little chance to expose myself to the latest new tracks, so I will simply focus on the tracks that are currently in heavy rotation at the house. As you can see, most of these tracks are almost a year old if not older. Regardless, I have gotten to really like these tracks and hope you get a kick out of them.

Since I am not spinning vinyl at the moment, because I have been told to keep the bass to a minimum by the ladies. I have been getting some tracks from <a href="http://www.beatport.com/">BeatPort</a> with great success. It is not quite <a href="http://www.bleep.com/">Bleep</a>, but it has a much wider selection of tracks.
It is good to see that getting tracks online is something that is actually possible now, although I find many of them lack the vinyl intros and outros.
