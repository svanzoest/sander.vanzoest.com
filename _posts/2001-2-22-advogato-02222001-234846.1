        <b>Advogato</b>
        <p>
I just found out about a new fun <a href="http://www.badvogato.org/">site</a> to keep track of
my
alter ego. So from now on my music, clothing, hair color and
alternative diary entries will be found <a href="http://www.badvogato.org/person/highgeek/">there</a>.
One of these days I will incorporate the XML into my
personal
site dynamicly. Hmm.. wish I had the time to do that. ;-)
