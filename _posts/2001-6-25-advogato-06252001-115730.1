After a week ago wondering <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/mp3/0,1285,42988,00.html">what happened to MusicBank</a> (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-5567835.html">2</a>) from
San Francisco. I now find another startup attempting to do
the same thing, but with WMA.

        <p><a href="http://www.thestandard.com/article/0,1902,27410,00.html">FullAudio</a> seems to have secured licensing from BMG and EMI. The author of the article states that this is the first subscription licensing done by EMI or BMG, but mean while MusicBank and MP3.com both have the licenses for subscription. So, I am not totally sure where he got his statement from. FullAudio's executive team listed on their website, does not show any technical backing, which makes you wonder if they
are totally relying on MS SDKs (see IP vs SDKs below). It will be interesting to watch how this $15 million of funding will manage.

I am surprised to see we have another contestant trying to fight the big five. It just looks like consumers and startups have no chance in fighting big label money. So far artists have felt &quot;milked&quot;, pretty soon we probably can add startups and consumers to that list.
