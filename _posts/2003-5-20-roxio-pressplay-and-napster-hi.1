<b>Roxio, Pressplay and Napster</b>

As rumored last week, Roxio has <a href="http://www.roxio.com/en/company/news/archive/prelease030519.jhtml">acquired</a> the remains of the music subscription service <a href="http://www.pressplay.com/">Pressplay</a>. A fair amount of the technology we developed at MP3.com (bought by  Vivendi Universal) was a foundation for Pressplay. So now it looks like Roxio is going to give it a shot with the Napster brand. The brand they <a href="http://www.roxio.com/en/company/news/archive/prelease021115.jhtml">acquired</a> last November.

After RealNetworks <a href="http://www.realnetworks.com/info/listen.html">bought</a> Listen.com and the launch of the new iTunes.  I think it is about time that we update <a href="http://david.weekly.org/">David Weekly</a>'s <a href="http://david.weekly.org/pho/graph/record.png">graph</a> of record companies (first posted on the <a href="http://www.pholist.org/">pho music list</a>). Who would have thought that the online music subscription services would get this hot. Summer is definitely here.

<b>Hi-Tech Fashion</b>

Since the days of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Mondo+2000+Magazine%22">Mondo 2000 Magazine</a>, the hi-tech fashions created out of their unique textiles, space age fabrics and slick plastics, have always been an interest of mine. They represent a unique twist on <a href="http://www.wearablegear.com/">wearable gear</a> and the &quot;new edge&quot; fashion trends. The futuristic cyberpunk world displayed in many noir sci-fi films are taking some of these counterculture ideas to the screen. Not because they are the latest designs shown on the catwalk by famous fashion designers, but more through the visions represented by the movies themselves. The fashion that normally was isolated in the world of erotic and fetish balls is making its way to your general population. A few years ago, I distinctly remember seeing a PVC jacket hanging in a department store in the mall. I wasn't browsing at <a href="http://www.syren.com/">Syren</a>, <a href="http://www.stormyleather.com/">Stormy Leather</a> or <a href="http://www.skintwo.com/">Skin Two</a>. No, this was just at the local, Fashion Valley Mall, here in San Diego.

In the recently released <a href="http://www.bradenton.com/mld/bradenton/entertainment/special_packages/matrix/5824859.htm">Matrix Reloaded</a>, costume designer <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Name?Barrett,%20Kym">Kym Barrett</a><a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_interview_kym_barrett.html">continued</a> the <a href="http://news.ft.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=FT.com/StoryFT/FullStory&amp;c=StoryFT&amp;cid=1051390099070"> trend</a> and <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1052766174299_90/">brought </a> some great new designs to the big screen. A <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/rl_interview_g_bava.html">priest-like coat for Neo</a> and the mixture of leather for close-ups, and PVC for Trinity and some alligator and reptilian for Niobe and Morpheus. Costume Cutter Roger Tait <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_interview_roger_tait.html#persephone">talks</a> about his experience of cutting Persephone's <a href="http://www.allposters.com/GetPoster.asp?APNum=379124&amp;f=c&amp;fid=798&amp;P=3&amp;PP=6">nude latex dress</a>. A dress that brings a more 40s formal, business-like cut to latex, but is right along the designs of <a href="http://www.libidex.co.uk/">Libidex</a> and <a href="http://www.innersanctum.uk.com/">Inner Sanctum</a>. I still would like to see someone create me that silver latex/PVC business suit that I have always dreamt of having. The days of my staple <a href="http://www.seriousclothing.com/">silver pants</a> are over. Of course the <a href="http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/rl_interview_kym_barrett_3.html">sunglasses</a> are still a big part of the costumes as well. I would like to check out a <a href="http://www.premierevision.fr/gb/sessions/sessions.html">Premi&#232;re Vision</a> fabric show one of these days. It would be neat to see what they would have for sale.
