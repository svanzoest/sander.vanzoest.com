As some of you may now, we are currently in the process of moving to the Netherlands. Just as it was moving to the United States, there are all sorts of hoops to jump through to get back into the normal swing of things. You'd figure since I am a originally from the Netherlands that it would be easier, but if you have been out of the country for more then a decade they have trouble finding your old records. So, we have been in an avalanche of chicken and egg scenarios.

One of the things that took a long time was finding a place to live. After almost two months arriving in the Netherlands we finally have the keys to our new home. Although, we are renting the place. It is completely bare and we are installing flooring with the help of our friendly co-workers and friends. The place is just on the outskirts of Leiden in a town named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oegstgeest">Oegstgeest</a>. It is a big milestone for us and we hope to move into the place, although we will continue to essentially live out of suitcase this week. Our container is waiting for us to jump through enough hoops so we can start the customs clearing process which will hopefully complete sometime next month.

It has been a crazy experience trying to move with our daughter in tow, but it is looking like we are slowly settling in. We would like to thank Dirk, Ardy, Pier and Satoko for their help in making our place more livable and we would like to thank Harrie for putting up with us for these last few weeks. I do not know what sort of place we would be moving into if it wasn't for his gracious offer to have us stay with him until we were able to find a place we liked.
