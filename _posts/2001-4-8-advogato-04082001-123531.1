Woke up this sunday morning finding out that
<a href="/person/krow/">krow</a> saw my presentation at
ApacheCon and
decided to take the hint of writing a <a href="http://www.tangent.org/mod_mp3/">mod_icecast for
Apache</a>. It
is pretty cool how you can show people the way, when you are
busy doing other things, at a conference. I am happy to see
that
someone brought the idea to life, now we will have to see
it live to a final release. I put my slides and notes up <a href="http://Sander.vanZoest.com/apachecon/2001/">on my
website</a>.
