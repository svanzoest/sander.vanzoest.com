There are a lot of new media players out there, but none of them were interesting enough for me to start using. It seemed that <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/jukebox/">iTunes</a> worked, although it was more of a love/hate relationship at times. But it is looking like I found a player that gives me a lot more control over the media that I consume. For Video it always has been <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLan Client</a> and it will probably stay that way for a while, but for music it has become <a href="http://www.machinecodex.com/audiocodex/">AudioCodex</a>.

I am sure it is not for everyone, especially since it requires OSX, but the ability to just run AudioUnits and have DJ-like controls such as pitch, BPM display and adjustment readily available is making for a great little media player. If you are into these sorts of things, check <a href="http://www.machinecodex.com/audiocodex/">it</a> out.
