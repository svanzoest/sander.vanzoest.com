Wow!, if you haven't ready noticed I have been pretty busy and keeping myself away from the journal. I currently spend most of my time cleaning up our home network, reviewing
books, random coding projects and spending time at the office. Yahoo! has been great! Great people. Great technology.
Great projects. It is close to home with the occasional trip to the bay area. What more would someone want from a job. It is good to be back home.

          <b>Online Music</b>
        </p>
        <p>
Lots of interesting developments in the online music world, but we are mostly still in licensing and political nightmare land with events such as the <a href="http://www.eff.org/alerts/20020322_eff_cbdtpa_alert.html">CDBTPA</a> Bill and KaZaA's battles with the world. I have been spending some more time looking at RTP and XML engines, but nothing concrete yet. I have been working on a perl XS module for <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> for a while now, I really should get around to putting an alpha copy on CPAN.

          <b>Apache HTTPd</b>
        </p>
        <p>
To my surprise <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTPd 2.0</a> seems to have been released to general audiences. This is very good news! I can't wait for the day FreeBSD's threading is solid enough for production use. Great work being done, I am going to have to find some time to help out. Right now I am just too busy with other things to find things to contribute, but I am sure I will come across things soon enough.
