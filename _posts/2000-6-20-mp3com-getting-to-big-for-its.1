One of the reasons I decided to leave MP3.com was because the company was slowly getting too big for its own good, especially after an IPO where it needs to start worrying about the shareholders rather then its services and consumers. When a company grows at such an insane rate it is really hard to bring the new people up to speed fast enough, while still keeping the same synergy. Our popularity also made it hard to keep up with demand, we were getting soo many new artists joining that it was hard to give that personal care that they all so desperately  wanted. People end up falling through the <a HREF="http://www.bpmusic.com/mp3_lame.html">cracks</a> and it can take a very long time (especially in net-time) to get them going again. It doesn't happen on purpose, it simply  is caused by growing pains and by demands for attention by different people pulling you all in a gazillion directions rather then focusing on your core goals. Since you are limited on time, you focus on the majority.

Although, I really enjoyed working there and thought it was a killer <a href="http://weblogs.oreillynet.com/tim/stories/storyReader$4">work environment</a>, it became quite obvious that the company had shifted its focus after IPO. Its main concern became the investors and shareholders before anything or anyone else. It became quite hard to move around terrabytes of music while not disturbing visitors to the site and artists uploading and making sure you did not accidentally leave a file uploaded by an artist in a black hole. It happens; not on purpose, but you can not deny it. It really comes with moving too fast. I am sure a lot of other fast growing businesses have similar experiences.
