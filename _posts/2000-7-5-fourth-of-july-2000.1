Things have been heck-tick  trying to get ready for my trip up north.  Cleaning up the apartment, paying off all the bills, etc. etc.

I am one of the original people who started and moderated the San Diego Gothic/Industrial Community site, but although I still want to contribute and be involved it looks like there are others who are interested in taking it over. I really wish I just had more time to contribute. I definately could use the help to get it going to the full extend I would like to see it go, I am just not too sure to what extend that would really be. Usually people claim that they want to contribute, but usually they
have other interests into getting involved and in the end end up contributing nothing. I hope I can at least keep the site running and provide as much technical support as I can. I really enjoyed the San Diego scene.

Fourth of July was a blast (other then the fact that I somehow got my DSL to blow up after I unplug its power cord). I spend some time with my good friends Adam and Lidija, Rachel, Riik , Dennis and later on with my old buddy <a HREF="http://clockwork.dementia.org/~tommy/">Tommy Tarka</a>. I also got to pull out my CD DJ gear which is always a pleasure and a blast. I played a wide mix from
Haujobb, Forma Tadre to X-Cabs, Imminent Starvation, Synapscape to X-Marks the Pedwalk and Banca De Gaia.

Only if I had more money and time to play with musical equipment. it is soo entertaining. It's gotta get to a point to where you can control your MIDI instruments with perl. :-)

Anyways, I am getting nervous for my trip. I am not sure if I will have enough time to really get everything done that I would like to before I leave. At least I had a chance to see most of my MP3.com buddies this Fourth of July.
