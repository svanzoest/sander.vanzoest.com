This is my first diary from my trip to San Fransisco. I must say that I had a wonderful time.

I really like the city. I have decided that I am going to take an opportunity in San Fransisco to work on some great projects and products. I am finalizing all of this now, so I do not want to talk about it too much until everything is settled. Starting my own business will have to wait for a while, because I felt that I could not pass this opportunity up.

On a different note my two new <a HREF="http://www.nectech.com/monitors/product_info/product.cfm?productid=121">monitors</a> arrived  yesterday with my new <a HREF="http://www.vanZoest.com/sander/howtos/dell_latitude_cpx650GT.html">laptop</a>. It is going to be fun installing FreeBSD and such onto this beast and get it configured correctly with the new monitors. I will most likely be going to San Fransisco starting July 10th, so I have a lot of things to do in San Diego before taking this trek up north.

I haven't been too on top of the news these last weeks, but hopefully I will still be able to point to some good articles in the next couple of days.
