A few months ago, I was wondering why my old stomping
grounds
were not in on either Duet or MusicNet, but this event
explains it.
So now it will be interesting to see what is going to
happen. It almost looks very much like a RTSP vs. HTTP
battle from a technology stand point.

I am starting to get really annoyed at little things that
people do. I
just hope I won't go crazy. It is good to be in San Diego.
It
gives me some time to look at the beach, do a couple of
climbs,
hikes and backpacks in the area to get away from it. I
really just
need to get more time to play with fun things such my
keyboard
and MacOS X. All will be good, got nothing to complain about
really.
