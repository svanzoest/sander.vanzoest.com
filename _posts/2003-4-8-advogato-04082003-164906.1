As I mentioned in my last entry, I have been looking into  what would be the best way to provide content on <a href="https://sander.vanzoest.com/">my personal website</a>, so that it would integrate with most journal/blog systems. It also required that it would work with XSLT, XML and general goodness. I thought there was no point updating my site unless I practiced what I preached. The site uses a lot of CSS2, which apparently isn't liked by IE, so I am not sure what I am going to do about that. Feel free to ping me if you got any ideas. I have taken some layout and artistic cues from the late 1920s movement of <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Arts/Art_History/Movements/De_Stijl/">De Stijl</a>. I have always enjoyed the works of Gerrit Rietveld, Piet Mondriaan and Theo van Doesburg so it seemed like a good fit.

Thing have been extremely busy as of late. I have been working hard at the first alpha release for a young startup in San Diego that is providing a phone and web ordering service to small restaurants. Since this is designed from  scratch we were able to use some new technologies such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/">VoiceXML 2.0</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/">SRGS 1.0</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT 1.0</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/">SOAP 1.1</a>. I will be taking another look at <a href="http://use.perl.org/~Matts/journal/">Matt Sergeant</a>'s ApacheCon SOAP Talk notes, to make sure we are still on track there. I'll try to get more detailed about what we are doing after we launch.

Luckly, I still found some time to wrap up some of the code I had laying around and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/SVANZOEST/">published</a> the perl wrapper around the <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org/products/client/">MusicBrainz Client SDK</a>. It still needs some I18N work, but I want to make sure it works with perl 5.8.0 and above, with potential backwards compatibility, rather then slapping on <a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/GAAS/Unicode-String/">Unicode::String</a>.

I also got around to installing ProTools 6.0.1 for MacOS X. Now the only thing that keeps MacOS 9 installed is <a href="http://www.akaipro.com/consumersite/productpage2.asp?id=110">Ak.Sys</a> for my Akai sampler. The CoreAudio drivers do not seem to like it when there is more then one access, which can be really annoying on a multi-threaded platform. Regardless, I am happy to have it available next to a couple of shells and Camino. The OMS/FreeMIDI replacement CoreMIDI, is a work of art. Apple did the right thing by <a href="http://aulos.calarts.edu/pipermail/music-dsp/2000-September/006033.html">hiring the developer of OMS</a> rather then licensing the defunct OMS from Gibson Guitar (who acquired Opcode Systems in 1998). It allows much better integration between programs using MIDI, to a point where I can use <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/">sfront</a> and <a href="http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/">MIDI monitor</a> next to <a href="http://www.digidesign.com/">ProTools</a>. Not much time spend on RTSP/RTP lately, but SIP seems to come up more  often then ever now these days.
