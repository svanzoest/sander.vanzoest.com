While still debating the idea of moving to San Fransisco for some of the opportunities that I am interested in, I do have doubts if I really want to leave the San Diego area. In the San Diego Union-Tribune there was <a HREF="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/business/20000618-0010_mz1b18silico.html">an article</a> giving some input to why I am struggling with this. We really will have to see how good the offers will be before I can say that moving up north would be of interest.

Another site of interest that I am not sure people have seen is the <a HREF="http://techdeals.findlaw.com/">Techdeals</a> section of Findlaw.com. It has all sorts of agreements and legal documents about company deals, IP and employment. Check it out.
