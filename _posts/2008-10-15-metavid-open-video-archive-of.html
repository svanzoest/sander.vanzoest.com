<p><a href="http://www.metavid.org/"><img style="float: right; border: 0" alt="" src="http://sander.vanzoest.com/2008/10/15/logo2.png" width="185" height="40" /></a> In light of the race for President, I would like to highlight a pretty neat non-profit project called <a href="http://www.metavid.org/">MetaVid</a>, which is a freely available archive of US Congress video clips, complete with semantic metadata, transcriptions and annotations in a wikipedia style.
</p>
<p> It allows for great searches for things like John McCain's and Barrack Obama's speeches that <a href="http://metavid.org/w/index.php?title=Special:MediaSearch&amp;order=relevant&amp;tracks=ht_en%2Canno_en%2Cthomas_en&amp;f[0][a]=and&amp;f[0][t]=match&amp;f[0][v]=iraq&amp;f[1][a]=and&amp;f[1][t]=spoken_by&amp;f[1][v]=John+McCain&amp;f[3][a]=or&amp;f[3][t]=spoken_by&amp;f[3][v]=Barack+Obama&tl=1">mention</a> Iraq. Or just about any other topic that you find interesting. 
</p>
<p>
The project uses lots of <a href="http://metavid.org/wiki/MetaVidWiki_Software">free software</a> including <a href="http://www.theora.org/">Theora</a>, <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> and <a href="http://www.annodex.net/">Annodex</a> technologies. It also provides a nice little <a href="http://metavid.org/w/index.php/Mv_embed">javascript library</a> ala <a href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/">swfobject</a> that helps with <a href="http://metavid.org/blog/2007/06/07/html5-video-the-future-is-now/">creating compatible playback of video</a> and has support for the upcoming <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/html5/video.html#video">video</a> element in <a href="http://whatwg.org/html5">HTML5</a>. Theora and the video element support should land in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080905-first-look-firefox-3-1-alpha-2-officially-released.html">FireFox 3.1</a>
</p>
<p>
It is a really nice project that shows you where video will be heading over the next couple of years. With in addition things such as SVG, the <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial">canvas</a> element, combined with HTML DOM manipulation, you can create some very powerful interfaces such as <a href="http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2007/08/svg-video-demo.html">this SVG Video demo</a> by Chris Double. Of course, since this is all early pre-release code, there is little to no hardware acceleration done. Hopefully this can be added over time, so it will playback nice and snappy, just as fast as native plugins can.
</p>
<p>
It will be great to see things such as <a href="http://diracvideo.org/">Dirac</a> be standardized as VC-2, the addition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Video_Coding">SVC</a> to AVC and see how that opens the playing field. So far the web and offline video have diverged quite a bit, so it will be an interesting thing to see if convergence will happen. Right now it is looking like the patent restricted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC">AVC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding">AAC</a> are the front runners for the new frontier, but hopefully there is still time and room for these free formats to take hold.

If you are excited about the Metavid project and have some time to contribute to it. Consider helping the project by <a href="http://metavid.org/blog/2008/10/09/a-more-perfect-archive/">improving the associated metadata</a> and therefore also increase the relevance of  the search engine, as it will be able to locate related content easier.
