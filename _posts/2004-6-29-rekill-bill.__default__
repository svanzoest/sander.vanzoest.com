Ever since the 4th film by <a href="http://www.tarantino.info/">Quentin Tarantino</a> hit the big screen, I knew that the movie would launch a few underground tunes containing a variety of "Kill Bill" <a href="http://www.sloth.org/samples/">samples</a> and remixed versions of tracks used through out <a href="http://www.killbill2.net/">the film</a>.

Of course, the original soundtracks provide you with some killer tracks from the movie score, keep in mind however, that these two soundtracks only contain a small sampling of all the tracks that were used in the film. There are several sites that attempt to make a complete list of them, so I won't try to list them here.

I wanted to talk about the underground remixes that I have found, with the hopes that some of you know of others. 

The largest collection of tracks can be found on the <a href="http://www.hanzosteel.net/">Hanzo Steel Vol 1 Limited Edition Remix CD</a>. This CD is being put together by the folks that bring us the <a href="http://www.onenationsd.com/">One Nation parties</a> at places such as <a href="http://www.thecasbah.com/">the Casbah</a> and the <a href="http://www.whistlestopbar.com/">Whistle Stop</a>. This CD contains a version of the <a href="http://www.hotei.com/">Tomoyasu Hotei</a> track "Battle without honor or humanity" remixed by Blackstone and Atari. The original track was used as the signature track for the movie. Blackstone and Atari overlay "Shout" by Tears for Fears which brings a unique twist to their version of the track.

Other tracks that remix/sample/related to the movie are:

<ul>
<li>Williams - Tomoyasu Hotei (White) - <i>Breaks</i></li>
<li>Dope Ammo - Kill Bill/The Unexpected (DA Industries) - <i>Hotei Drum &amp; Bass Remix</i></li>
<li>Timmy Vegas - Kill Bill (Anything) - <i>Twisted Nerve Remix</i></li>
<li>Kill Bill - Misunderstood (White) - <i>Santa Esmeralda House Mix</i></li>
<li>Digital Cowboy vs Danny Gilligan - Kill Bill/Powwer (Vacuum) - <i>hard tech trance, Mix?</i></li>
<li>Robbie Long and AMS - Kill Bill/Here we go (Thin N' Crispy Promo) - <i>Happy Hard Core, Mix?</i></li>
</ul>

Of the ones above, I found the Dope Ammo and Williams tracks to be the most entertaining. Although at times, I can't wait to listen to the house beat layed along the Twisted Nerve track by Timmy Vegas. It also uses the   sound effects provided on the first soundtrack to transition between parts of the song.

Oh, and I still expect Tarantino to release a single Kill Bill boxset (similar to <a href="http://aznfilms.com/product_info.php/products_id/1133">the Japanese one</a>) that contains the complete Kill Bill movie in <a href="http://www.empireonline.co.uk/site/features/special/killbill/default.asp">a single edit</a>.

Let me know if you find any others, I am hoping to collect them all.
