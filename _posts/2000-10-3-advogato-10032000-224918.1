 As brought up on several music and technology sites, <a href="http://www.sdmi.org/">SDMI</a> is looking for someone to <a href="http://www.HackSDMI.com/">hack</a> their latest watermarking. After doing a little hacking, I realized that however much fun it was,  it really didn't matter.

Since we really want to find something that allows for our current &quot;fair use&quot; rights, having what we have now would be a good solution from the consumer perspective. As an artist this might be a little bit of a different story, but you definately would like to make your own decisions and get compensated for your work, rather then giving a huge share to the record labels.

After getting several &quot;employment opportunities&quot; from different label projects such as Sony's &quot;digital locker&quot; project. I really look at this as an attempt to undermine the consumers interest. Therefore, as an <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> member, I am <a href="http://www.eff.org/cafe/">Boycotting the HackSDMI challenge</a>. Whose servers, ironicly, sit only a single hop away from my co-lo box.

 <a href="http://salon.com/tech/feature/2000/10/03/hacksdmi_fallout/">This salon article</a> (note: I am currently working in the ex-salon offices in San Francisco.) Points out some interesting view points of some of the technology industry members of
the SDMI.  Although, I think they might have a point, I still think probably the best way to ensure consumers rights is to Boycott the challenge. Hopefully they will then go live with a technology that is seriously broken and we can go on with life.

Things seem much more stable. I am working on cleaning up the layout a little bit. Making it more plain in a hope the pages will load faster and will format a little better. Slowly but surely things are getting much like the way I envision it. It is still pretty far away from that, but I enjoy the progress I have been seeing in it.
