It has been a while since I have written anything here, but rest assured lots is happening. I just haven't had the time to put it into words. Some changes are happening on the server as well, as we found a new host after so many years and are also upgrading the software. This is causing some broken links, unfortunately, and also some brokenness caused by the porting of the old theme, but I hope to clean that up in the next couple of days.

Please excuse the growing pains.

Best,
