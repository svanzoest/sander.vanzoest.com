Sorry for the fact that I haven't written an entry for a while. I should get my studio in North Beach on Tuesday, so that should give me some more room and a place to hack at other then the office.

I got an <a HREF="http://www.wavelan.com/">ORINOCO WaveLAN card</a> and an <a HREF="http://www.msrl.com/airport-gold/">Apple Airport</a> that I hope to plug into DSL for connectivity at home. It should be pretty bitchin.

I have been working on a cool XML project that hopefully should be live sometime next week, I will keep you posted.

Adjusting to the new environment and being away from the woman I love has been tough to say the least, but I am slowly starting to see the light and how much fun work is going to be. 

<a HREF="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/">LinuxWorld</a> really sucked and I am happy to say that I only had to be there for 2 days.  

I have been playing with a new personal project which is an AudioFS for <a HREF="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=126715+130016+/usr/local/www/db/text/2000/freebsd-hackers/20000806.freebsd-hackers">FreeBSD</a> written by Theo van Klaveren. He told me that he should have another version out soon that he has been working on that is suppose to be more stable which I am really looking forward to. When working on <a HREF="http://www.birdhouse.org/mp3/">MP3: The definitive Guide</a> we had a list of several Audio  FS types for different OSes such as BeOS. I am happy to see we got one underway for my favorite OS, <a HREF="http://www.FreeBSD.org/">FreeBSD</a>.
