          <b>Music Industry</b>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p><a href="/person/ask/">ask</a>, this doesn't really come
with too much
of a
surprise. Universal is the biggest record label around. They
probably
have the most money and have been squeezing artists the
longest. See <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010521/n2115113.html">this
article</a> for some third party insight.

          <b>My view on MP3.com history</b>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>
The most interesting point of this all, is that we started
out MP3.com as an alternative way to distribute music. A way
to find
out about all the different music in the world to find the
music
you wanted to listen to without having the labels pre-pick
your
favorite music style for you. We seem to totally have gone
full
circle to a point to where we aligned with Emusic who had a
totally
different strategy which was very much aligned to the old
record
label A&amp;R way of doing things.

</p>
        <p/>
        <p>
I guess it is too hard to really find the good stuff via a
big single source like we had hoped. We figured people could
&quot;rate&quot; (download) the songs they liked and therefore bump it
up the charts. This would be a way to provide the music the
world wanted
not what some folks in the A&amp;R group at a random record
label thought you would want to hear.

</p>
        <p/>
        <p>
So maybe your best bet would still be the small indie label
that
has interests in the particular style of music you like, as
long as
they do not get corrupted by seeing dollar signs.

</p>
        <p/>
        <p>
Again, this is a good example of what record labels have
done soo
well and continue to do well in the past. Use money to make
money.
The original goal of having internet distribution for all
artists without serious costs to provide a closer link
between the artist and
music consumer seems to have been shot. Mass media has
always
been controlled by only a few companies in the world that
can
easily leave out important information for financial gain.
This only
proves the fact that money conquers.

Although going public gave us a lot of money and power to
play with it also brought a lot of stock holders and
investors in on the
game that were looking only at profits. This caused the
focus of
the company to change drasticly towards making money. At
least
to me the company slowly changed their goals after IPO. It
was
no longer the same goal we were fighting for.

          <b>Online Audio Distribution Technology</b>
        </p>
        <p/>
        <p>
The most interesting part to me would be to see how the
Technology side will pack out now that the majors are
starting to
get their feet wet. Will MP3 and Vorbis which still stand as
the
consumer favorite come out of this alive? Or will DRM-type
formats
surpass the more open standards because consumers want to
pay
for someone to sift through the music (record labels) to
present them with something that has been mass marketed over
the radio and television. My.MP3.com was a great
technological idea that tried to provide a way to deliver
your music to you digitally where ever you where (provided
you had connectivity). Of course this is only useful if you
can store a lot of music and if it would be easier then
lugging around a CD-ROMs with your favorite MP3s on it.

        <p/>
        <p>
On the streaming side of things it will be interesting to
see if
semi-new IETF streaming standards such as RTSP, RTP, SIP and
the like will be used by any of these companies that are
building
this subscription service for the record labels. So far the
only a few
that have started using RTSP such Apple Quicktime and Real
Networks RealPlayer and JMF (Cacheflow, Sun StoreEdge  and 
others have created Servers, Proxies, Mixers and
Translators). So
there is some support for streaming Vorbis and/or MP3 over
RTSP/RTP, but not too much.

        <p>
From what I know about the Online Music Industry most
companies
that are distributing music are using HTTP derrivates such
as Shoutcast, Icecast or just a M3U based hand off to an
HTTP capable
audio client. Although it has been effective alternatives
now exist
that are more reliable and scalable (but also more complex
and harder to implement), most distribution companies
haven't taken
advantage of these new standards. Maybe now that it will be
a lot
less about investors, it will become more of a technology
gain. Hopefully some of my old co-workers are reading this
and start looking at some of these new protocols.

        <p/>
        <p>
Maybe I will find some more time to play with this stuff.
Also
the XML/DC/MusicBrainz/ID3v2/CDDB/MPEG-7 stuff is a good
hobby of mine. It is interesting how a lot of this audio
stuff is
crossing over into my usual XML/HTTP development that is
done
for work. It is great to have them overlap every once in a
while,
but sometimes I wish they could be two totally seperate
beasts.
