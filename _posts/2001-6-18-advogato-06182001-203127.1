I got word back from my <a href="http://www.ApacheCon.com/">ApacheCon</a> proposal. I really should have submitted something for the O'Reilly Open Source convention since it is going to be held next month here in San Diego. Oh well. I got accepted to do an updated
repeat of my &quot;Audio and Apache&quot; talk, but my talk on &quot;XML and I18N&quot; from my experiences parsing mail files and my experience with I18N issues with designing the MP3.com publishing is accepted only for fallback purposes.

It is kind of a bummer, because I would have rather had the
talks the other way around. I don't mind doing an updated talk on &quot;Audio and Apache&quot;, but figured I would rather present something new on a topic not directly covered yet.
Oh well, next time I guess. Now I need to figure out if I
am going to go to Dublin and if/how I am going to be able
to cover the cost of taking my S.O. with me.

Work has been going great. Started working on new projects that are semi exciting but more a direct need for the company. I am pretty happy about it and hope I can avoid a lot of the hassles by keeping some things my hobby and not having to argue about it.

I have been in the process of labeling and organizing all my
CDs and Vinyl in such a way that I can finally figure out what I want in a split second while DJing or at least keep the cases with the actual pressing. My S.O. and I have been
busy coming up with a flexible database schema that we can use for a database to keep track of what  we have what we like and don't like and how every musician is related to the next. Great stuff before I dive back into doing some studio work, playing with instruments rather then mixing.

I also can't wait till a lot of the Pro Audio tools that I use on the Mac move forward to MacOS X. I will actually be able to do some perl scripting against things and use some of the useful DSP/MIDI code that exists on the net and contribute back to it.

Lots of new political games being played in the industry with the release of ProMP3 and other exciting little tools that are patented and closed source. Oh well, it can't rain all the time.
