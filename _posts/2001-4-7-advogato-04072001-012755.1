          <b>ApacheCon 2001</b>
        </p>
        <p>
A few hours ago I finished my talk about Audio and Apache at
ApacheCon in Santa Clara. It turned out to be a pretty well
attended
talk. I had some issues with getting slides going because my
laptop had been behaving badly because of the broken
<i>i</i>,
<i>k</i>,<i>,</i> keys.

</p>
        <p>
I had brought up a point of how increasing the TimeOut
directive
seemed to have kept more streams alive then having the
default
time out and this brought up some discussions with some
members
of the ASF such as gregames,
<a href="/person/mjcox/">mjcox</a> and <a href="/person/dirkx/">dirkx</a>. It
was good to hear the discussion on this especially cause i
never really thought much about it.

</p>
        <p>
The mod_perl BOF was fun. We totally surrounded our friendly
python co-worker, <a href="/person/Jick/">Jick</a>. Met some more of
the mod_perl
folks that I had not met yet in London or Orlando. Perrin
and
buddy did a nice talk on some of the architecture done at
Etoys.

</p>
        <p>
And I also spend some time catching up with the Covalent
folks
which was very much needed. Over all a very good conference
with lots of great people to talk and hang out with.

          <b>Work and Code</b>
        </p>
        <p>
I have been hacking at home on work which has been a lot of
fun and I am finally getting the hang on things again. I
ended
up missing the mod_xslt BOF which I am still kinda bumbed
about, so if you were in this, please let me know how to get
on
the mailing list if there ever is one started. I was up
pretty late
the night before working on code and slides.

          <b>Weekend</b>
        </p>
        <p>
I am spending the weekend in SF hopefully meeting up with
<a href="/person/fanf/">fanf</a> and <a href="/person/lars/">lars</a> then back to
code on
Monday. Looks like my SF Studio is finally rented out as
well. Which
is a big sigh of relief off of my shoulders.

</p>
        <p>
I can't wait to get back into code after a great week like
this! I really wish I had time to hack on
MacOS X,
so far from what I have seen it is a dream come true from a
nice GUI
with BSD underneath.
