        <b>Work and code</b>
        <p>
Boy has it been good being back in San Diego. I get to code
from
my own home on my own <a href="http://www.hmstore.com/">Aeron Chair</a>. It took a
little
cleaning up and getting my head back into code. Things are
still very busy, but I am starting to feel much better about
a lot
of things.

I just recently turned in my <a href="http://www.apachecon.com/2001/US/">ApacheCon</a> paper
that talks about how to deliver audio over the net and how
it integrates with the Apache HTTPD. It is a pretty basic
level paper,
but a good recap of what is going on and documents some of
the
stuff that I have always wanted people had documented. It
wasn't
the best paper written,  in some sense it was a rush job,
but still
had has some nice jewels in there for those not too familiar
with 
the audio streaming scene.

I haven't had much time to work on other things. I just got
a new
Ultra 10 at the home office now, but I haven't even turned
it on yet.
Too many things to play with and soo little motivated time.

I still haven't found anyone to move into my <a href="http://www.rent.net/direct/northpointapts">NorthPoint</a>
studio in North Beach, San Francisco and I will never find
any time
to work on some of my organizing projects and catagorization
of
things around the house.
