On a recent trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen">Shenzhen, CN</a>, Bunnie <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/wordpress/?p=139">found</a> an iPod knock off and as he tends to do, he opened it up and shared it with all of us. It is interesting to compare the knock off and its capabilities with the real deal. Since you are only paying for hardware and the software and licensing costs go to nil, you end up with a very cheap device. He also mentions some of the reasons behind the sometimes blatant typos that tend to exist on these devices.

Bunnie has a monthly contest called "Name that ware" which asks visitors to name a piece of hardware based on pictures of its innards. I totally suck at it, but it is very interesting to see the experts at work.
