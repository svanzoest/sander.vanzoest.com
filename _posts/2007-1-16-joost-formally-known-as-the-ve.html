After the last few weeks working on the grant brand reveal, we now have launched under the new brand <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joostâ„¢</a>. The brand is pronounced as "juiced" unlike the dutch first name Joost which is pronounced as "yoast". I can probably save a few minutes every day now that I only have to type five characters rather then sixteen.

I will adjust the category on this site to reflect the new name.
