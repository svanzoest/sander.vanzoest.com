Well, I finally made it up to San Francisco. I am currently in an Executive Apartment kinda place that is fully furnished while  spending most of my free time looking for a more perminent place to stay in this city.

I still call back and forth with my unlimited mobile-to-mobile cell phone to talk to my girlfriend and such. I was talking with the PacBell PCS folks here on California street and they claim that there is no way they can simply stack on another phone number to my nokia 6190 GSM phone, which although technically is possible, is really annoying.

If I could simply keep my 858 area code number and service and tack on a 415 area code number for the San Francisco folks I would have it made, but for whatever reason they are not willing to take this on. It is really annoying when something technologically is really simple and possible, but for business or accounting reasons
(or maybe simply because of cluelless sales folks) this is not possible. So, anyone who has experience with this and is reading this feel free to send me an e-mail.

Work has been an entire new thing as well, I have been spending most of my time getting a demo box ready for the O'Reilly Conference next week, but I haven't really gotten into coding yet. I still need to get myself in a reasonable matter on all the
mailing lists again. I still haven't gotten my entire mail sorted
out yet.
