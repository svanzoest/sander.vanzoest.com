It has been ages since I have made any changes to my personal site. So, this weekend, I decided to spend the time and update the look and feel a bit and make the site more modern. 

I wil be making small tweaks over the upcoming months to make it fully compliant and bring back some of the old data I had on my site.

I also imported most of my old blog entries since 2000 that were scattered all over the net, which should provide a good archive for those of you who were not familiar with my previous writing.
