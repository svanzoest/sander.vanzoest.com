Ever since meeting <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/">Bunnie</a> through <a href="http://www.caustik.com">Caustik</a>, I have found him to be very open minded and enlightening. I miss staying up late with them, hacking, mixing or dancing away to the latest tunes. It is always a pleasure to meet up.

Lately both Caustik and Bunnie have been working hard on bringing us one of the most interesting gadgets, the <a href="http://www.chumby.com/">Chumby</a>. While setting out to create this little ball, Bunnie explored the land of China to produce it. Along the way, he learned a lot about the countries culture and the incredible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexterity">dexterity</a> and commitment to a project of its workers. He posted this in lots of detail on his blog under <a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?cat=7">Made in China</a>. I normally would like to provide feedback on Bunnies observations, but Bunnie really says it all. Bunnie, we really appreciate you sharing this with all of us.
