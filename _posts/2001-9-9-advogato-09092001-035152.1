First Microsoft escapes break up because our 
government feels it has taken way too long. Now
we get this new 
<a href="http://216.110.42.179/docs/
hollings.090701.html">SSSCA</a> bill that pretty
much takes away the rights that consumers have
been taking for granted. It pretty much is build on
the experience of the <i>big five</i> and the <i>RIAA</i>
. Although I haven't had the time yet to read the 
document in detail, but it seems like it is a way for
them to protect them from technology moving faster 
then they would like it too. Online music services are
going to have a very hard time existing for 
independents that do not have the money to prove that 
their way is a reasonable way of doing business on the 
net.

Add <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/08/
business/08TRUS.html">this</a>(reg req'd) event to 
the list and it 
clearly shows that we need a whole new government 
setup or something, because what ever happened to 
the rights of the consumer and residents of this 
country.

        <p><a href="/person/kgb/">kgb</a>, let me know where 
you 
decide to move to. I have been reading about living in 
different places of the world, now maybe I will have to 
include property and patent law as well as a 
consideration. Arghh, this is probably going to limit my 
options a considerable amount. Doesn't look good. I 
am not sure if becoming a US. Citizen to see about 
voting the next election would help prevent these kinds 
of things. Sad times at the beginning of this new
billennium.

Lots of interesting conferences coming up (besides the 
canceled apachecon).
 <a href="http://www.cmj.com/marathon/">CMJ 
Marathon</a>, 
<a href="http://www.icmc2001.org/">International 
Computer Music Conference</a>, 
<a href="http://www.streamingmedia.com/">Streaming 
Media East</a> and of course the 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>. I will most likely 
miss out on most if not all of them because of limited 
time and finances.
