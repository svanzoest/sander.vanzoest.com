In addition to the many mapping projects out there, such as <a href="http://www.maporama.com/share/">Maporama</a>, <a href="http://www.geourl.org/">GeoURL</a> and the <a href="http://terraserver-usa.com/">MS TerraServer</a>. I just recently found the <a href="http://www.californiacoastline.org/">California Coast Records Project</a>. It provides you with the ability to see the california coast from the ocean. Can you <a href="http://www.californiacoastline.org/cgi-bin/image.cgi?image=9411&amp;mode=sequential&amp;flags=0">see</a> our apartment? Combine this view with the satellite views and you have a neat way of locating your dream house along the beach. I wonder how long it will take before the real estate market will tap into this.

Apparently, there is an  <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200307/smallstep.asp">article</a> in this months Sierra Magazine that explains more about the founder and his goals for the site. This obviously is quite useful for the  <a href="http://www.ocrm.nos.noaa.gov/">Ocean and Coastal Resource Management</a>, <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/ca/coasts/">Sierra Club</a> and the <a href="http://www.votethecoast.org/">Vote the Coast</a> projects. At the same time some people have <a href="http://www.californiacoastline.org/concerns.html">various concerns</a> with a site that catalogs the coastline. It even causes Barbra Streisand to <a href="http://www.californiacoastline.org/news/la-me-barbra30may30.html">sue</a> the project, because it provides an unusual view of her coastal home.
