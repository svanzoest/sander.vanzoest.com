          <b>Work and code</b>
        </p>
        <p>
Not much (any?) work was done this weekend and I will be
driving up from San Diego to San Francisco in a few minutes.

Read some of the Google <a href="http://www7.scu.edu.au/programme/fullpapers/1921/com19
21.htm">research paper</a> (<a href="/person/jauderho/">jauderho</a>), and 
looked at some of the Freehaven ones mentioned by 
<a href="/person/raph/">raph</a>, but I will probably not 
be able to
give a thorough read till sometime next week.

          <b>Busy Week Ahead</b>
        </p>
        <p>
I have a busy
week ahead of me, which includes moving stuff from San 
Francisco to San Diego and many design meetings, read up on
their docs and being able to provide some constructive 
feedback.
</p>
        <p>
My friend Martin is moving back to Italy next week, so it
would be nice to be able to spend some time with him as 
well. Just too many things to do with soo little time.
</p>
        <p>
Still have to do taxes and talk to Pacbell about why I
do not want to pay a DSL bill of two months when I only
had service for about 2 minutes.

Btw, wish <a href="/person/dirkx/">dirkx</a> a happy 
birthday! ;-)
