        <b>Code and Work</b>
        <p>
I have been finishing up my patches to the autoconf/libtool
stuff
for Apache HTTPD 2.0 to build it outside the source tree.
There
were some dependencies that didn't work together too well
with
APR and APR-UTIL. I should be able to post this on the
APR/new-httpd list later today or tomorrow.

I have noticed a lot of people talking in their diaries
about <a href="/proj/e-smith%20server%20and%20gateway/">e-smith</a>
which I decided to take a quick look at. Pretty interesting
project, it looks like a KDE/GNOME type play, but more on
the
server side of things.

          <b>Friends</b>
        </p>
        <p>
I have been spending a decent amount of time in the
evenings
hang out with <a href="/person/dirkx/">dirkx</a>, ardy,
harrie, <a href="/person/fanf/">fanf</a> and harrie. Talking about most
of
the different drives between people in Europe versus the US
and
big corporations, consulting and start ups. Overall an
enlightening
conversation that touches on some of the Ph.D. points
mentioned
in peoples diaries such as <a href="/person/neale/">neale</a> and
<a href="/person/chromatic/">chromatic</a>. I might find the time to write
up roughly what we discussed.

          <b>Environment</b>
        </p>
        <p><a href="/person/mbp/">mbp</a>: I love my Aeron Chair. I had one at
MP3.com, demanded for one in my negotiations with Covalent
and
now even have one for home. ;-) They are expensive, but are
a lot
cheaper then replacing your back or productivity.

On the
same
topic anyone know of a fully split keyboard (ala <a href="http://www.ergointerfaces.com/">Interfaces</a>) that
is very
sturdy without a number keypad? The interfaces was pretty
close to
what I wanted (it even had the double '6's), but it would
nice to
ditch the number keypad and have a more old school ibm style
keyboard.
