As I have mentioned before, I have been getting some of my new tracks in digital form from <a href="http://www.beatport.com/">Beatport</a> lately, as I am not really setup right now to listen to them in vinyl, nor do I have the time to convert the vinyl to FLAC and MP3s.

As it turns out, Beatport just recently decided to give existing customers 3 free credits in honor of their three year anniversary. I have some ideas as to what I would get, but I have a better idea. What would you get if you had 3 credits at <a href="http://www.beatport.com/">Beatport</a>? Please leave your suggestion as a comment and I will make a later posting as to what I actually ended up getting.
