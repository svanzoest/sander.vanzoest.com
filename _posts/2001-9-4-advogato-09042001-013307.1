With the acquisition complete and public figure
Michael Robertson moving on to other things; I am
sure we are going to see a lot of changes at the
online music service provider. Now with some
fun articles at <a href="http://www.hitsmagazine.com/">
Hits Magazine</a> and an engineering department
that will have to spend more effort to explain technical
details to the executive team, we will never know what
will come of it. I really hope things go well, because 
there are still a lot of great people there that I hope
will be able to survive these changes without too much
hassle.

        <p>
I really appreciate <a href="/person/mbp/">mbp</a> for posting 
the engineering perspective on VCs. It  ironed out 
some loose thoughts and combined them to a more 
solid perspective. It would be really great to have some
of the rich techie types help finance some technological 
start ups that can push the envelope. Although, 
companies like Google are definately showing that with 
some research done ahead of time you can even 
conquer the wel established.

          <b>Quality of Living</b>
        </p>
        <p>
I have been spending a lot of time thinking about this. 
Especially from my time spend in the bay area. If you 
look at housing and real estate alone it is soo 
expensive to live up there it is rediculous. You are going 
to have to take some serious risks to survive or be 
willing to deal with the hassles of public transportation 
or sitting in traffic commuting to more reasonable 
areas to live.

I spend a few days last week with a friend of mine living
in Las Vegas. It put a whole new perspective on my life 
and made me think about getting a better perspective 
on the pros-n-cons of living in San Diego, California or 
just about anywhere in the world for that matter. The 
differences to what kind of real estate you can afford 
and the different tax laws in different states and 
countries are tremendous. It can really make a huge 
difference in how you spend your day and how much 
money you really would need to have an enjoyable life.

          <b>Technology</b>
        </p>
        <p>
I have been spending some time learning about Cocoa 
frameworks to get familliar with the Audio and 
Quicktime APIs. I have also been spending some more 
time playing with the Darwin Streaming Server. It has 
been a good experience and since I am doing it in my 
own time, I do not have to worry about how long I am 
taking and if I am hitting the unrealistic deadlines as 
set by management. Which is always good.

</p>
        <p>
There are a couple of other projects that have been on 
my mind for a while such as upgrading components on
a few of my servers and writing some cataloging code 
for a database of our music collection. If we do not get 
that up soon enough, it could get pretty seriously out of 
hand keeping track of things. This might finally be an
excuse to integrate some of the <a href="http://
www.musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> project. To be 
able to integrate the loads of Vinyl I have it might make 
sense to record some of it for cataloging and back up 
purposes. Scanning in the barcodes would probably 
also be a good idea. It will be great to have this finally in 
place, it will make music purchasing soo much easier 
and knowing what ever happened to that one CD and 
how come I ended up with having two copies of it.

I have been spending some more time learning the 
insides and out of the new Virus TDM Synth plugin that
I finally got working. (Yeah!). It required me to get a 
particular USB floppy drive for authorization, since my 
G4 (DA) doesn't come with a floppy drive. It looks like 
some of the plug-in developers are trying to use other 
authentication methods such as an OPIE challenge 
response system linked to your hard drive by <a href="http://www.kindofloud.com/">Kind of Loud</a> to new 
hardware USB keys such as the <a href="http://
www.ilok.com/">iLok</a> and the <a href="http://
www.ibutton.com/">iButton</a>. Now I wonder how the 
labels would have felt if you needed one of these to 
listen to your music online (ala my.mp3.com)? I mean 
these keys are useful in crypto cases such as SSL and 
such. But I am sure you can see it now, someday some 
one will steal your wallet containing your music card 
and your eyeballs to be able to hear the latest tunes of 
their favorite artists that you were evaluating.

</p>
        <p>
It is odd how we went from analog synth to software 
synths and now we are going back to physical circuitry 
for authentication purposes. You are going to have to 
replace all your rack modules with USB keys and hubs.

        <p>
Anyways, till next time
