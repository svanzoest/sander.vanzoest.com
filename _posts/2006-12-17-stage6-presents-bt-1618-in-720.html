A few days after my last day at <a href="http://www.divx.com/">DivX</a>, I had some of my old co-workers informed me that Electronic artist <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/artist/88e2147d-0332-46f6-85b2-b5f463ba957b.html">BT</a> (also known as Brian Transeau) was in the office. Obviously, being a big electronic music fan and I was bummed to hear I missed out, but simultaneously happy to hear DivX was working with BT. I have had his latest album, <a href="http://www.thisbinaryuniverse.com/">This Binary Universe</a>, for more then a month now and it is quite an experience. I am normally not that much into downtempo type music, but combined with the video it sets a very different mood. I wish I could have gone to one of his screenings, but I rarely get a chance to go to a show these days.  I think the last show was seeing <a href="http://www.satoshitomiie.com/">Satoshi Tomiie</a> at the Karma Lounge of <a href="http://www.obec.tv/">On Broadway</a> several months ago.

Anyways, you will find the BT track named <a href="http://stage6.divx.com/BT/show_video/1051714">1.618</a> in DivX HD 720p with high quality <a href="http://www.mp3surround.com/">MP3 Surround</a> audio on <a href="http://stage6.divx.com/BT">Stage6</a>, which is nothing short of amazing to watch. Unfortunately, I do not have a 5.1 setup in my studio or office, so I was not able to take advantage of the MP3S audio encoding. However, having listened to the DVD I must say surround sound is a must have. I tried to play back the HD clip on our <a href="http://www.consumer.philips.com/consumer/catalog/catalog.jsp?productId=DVP5960_37_US_CONSUMER">Philips DVP 5960/37 DivX Ultra Certified DVD Player</a>, but it said it didn't support 720p via the USB drive. Which is not surprising, but it was worth a shot.  I would only assume that this would playback  on <a href="http://www.divx.com/products/hw/browse.php?c=7">a HD capable player</a>, such as the <a href="http://www.iodata.com/usa/products/products.php?cat=HNP&sc=AVEL">I-O Data AVeL LinkPlayer2</a>. If you have 5.1 speakers hooked up to your computer, or you simply haven't seen the beauty of DivX in HD before. Be sure to check <a href="http://stage6.divx.com/BT/show_video/1051714">it out</a>, otherwise enjoy it in <a href="http://stage6.divx.com/BT/show_video/1051714">Home Theater with MP3S</a>.

Also, be sure to watch <a href="http://stage6.divx.com/BT/show_video/1052242">the very candid interview</a> by  Alastair "Digital56K" Mayo at BT's home in front of a <a href="http://www.monomachine.com/">Elektron Monomachine</a>.
</p>
<p>
BT talks about the creation of his latest album <a href="http://www.thisbinaryuniverse.com/">This Binary Universe</a> in depth. He discusses how he found the animators, how he financed it and its tour among other things. It was also interesting to hear his thoughts around being a new father and how that relates to his music. It reminded me of my experiences with <a href="http://jasmine.vanzoest.com/">my daughter</a> while messing around in the home studio. BT also talks about music discovery via the internet and how it is truly a curse and a blessing for someone who does music for a living. He mentions that his records did not bring in any money and how compensates other artists when he likes a particular track. He mentions a variety of ways to find music including one of <a href="http://sander.vanzoest.com/2006/11/november_2006_playlist.html">my</a> online  favorites <a href="http://www.beatport.com/">BeatPort</a>. He makes a brief mention of <a href="http://www.csounds.com/">csound</a> and how he integrated orchestral works into his album, but the one hour interview focuses primarily on what it took to create his latest album.</p>
<p>
All and all, some great new content on <a href="http://stage6.divx.com/">Stage6</a> provided in its signature quality. Enjoy!
