<a HREF="http://pr.mp3.com/pr/48.html">Fleischers</a>' old home <a HREF="http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/">Hits Magazine</a> has <a HREF="http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/news/rumormill.cgi">an interesting rumor</a> on their site. 

<i>&quot;MP3 NEEDS TO JIBE WITH JIVE: The MP3.com
      deal with BMG, negotiated last week, does not
      include Britney Spears, NSYNC, the Backstreet
      Boys or any other Jive act, which means the Music
      Service Provider will have to negotiate a separate
      agreement with the label.&quot;</i>.

They also have more info on <a HREf="http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/news/newsPage.cgi?news00624m01">the other rumor</a> although it has been said that MP3.com is not for sale.

I am also working on plans to be in San Fransisco part of next week. <a HREF="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix2000/">USENIX 2000</a> and the <a HREF="http://www.mp3summit.com/">MP3 Summit</a> are both in San Diego then, so it will be a busy but  productive week. :)
