Started playing again with some <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Data_Formats/Markup_Languages/XML/">XML</a>
tools. There have been a lot of cool ones
coming out, since I last checked, to validate DTD/schemas
and allow you to edit
with a
DTD restricting you. Tools such as <a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/xeena">Xeena</a>,
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/DDbE">DDbE</a>
and
some of David Megginson's  <a href="http://www.megginson.com/Software/">additions</a> to
PSGML for <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Linking">XPointer</a>. Also
looks like <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html">PSGML</a>
is being shelved onto
source forge with hopes others will contribute. I hope this
doesn't
mean I need to give up my trusty emacs.

        <p><a href="http://www.gingerall.com/">Sablotron</a> latest
versions do not ./configure anymore on my FreeBSD 4.2-STABLE
system because of the lack of ANSI C Wide
Character support.
Lots of talk on FreeBSD mailing lists, so I guess this will
be done soon. There have been lots of code flying around
including
talks of integrating code from
the <a href="http://citrus.bsdclub.org/">
CITRUS</a> project or <a href="http://citrus.bsdclub.org/xpg4dl/">xpg4dl</a> which
got imported by NetBSD. I had
some
code off the list that I played with for a while, but
figured I should
probably downgrade for now to 0.44 of Sablotron till the
wchar stuff gets integrated into FreeBSD 5.0-CURRENT.

        <p>
Hit up just about every record shop that I know of in
Downtown
Berkeley over the weekend from Amoeba, Rasputin to Skills DJ
Workshop.
It
was a pretty good run (read bad for my wallet.) and I got
some
Tilt, Christian West, Squaremeter, Clicks and Cuts and other
stuff.
Still kinda bummed I didn't pick up the new Cass: Cerebral
Noodles EP (Really need
to watch for is Fire Recordings stuff. Should be good.) Oh
well,
I got more chances to get things. My girlfriend got her
Chicane
fix from the Xtravaganza tab at Skills. It was pretty
interesting
to see her face light up with the fact they actually had a
tab for
one of her favorite labels.

</p>
        <p> I need to check out some
the
places in the Haight Area such as Frequency-8, BPM and
others. I will doing some traveling between San Diego and
San Francisco on a semi-regular basis (not like I haven't
been),
so it will be interesting to what the differences will be
between
<a href="http://www.otrvinyl.com/">Off the
Record</a>, <a href="http://www.calsound.com/">CSL</a>,
Equinox and
the
Bay Area shops.

Anyways.. till next time.</p>
