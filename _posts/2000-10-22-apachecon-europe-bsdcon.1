I am currently kicking it  in london for <a href="http://www.ApacheCon.com/20000/EU/">ApacheCon</a>. Hanging out with many including <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/Jick/">Jick</a>, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/daniel/">daniel</a>, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/dirkx/">dirkx</a> and others.
I will put up some <a href="https://sander.vanzoest.com/pictures/apachecon-eu/">pictures</a> of this weekend which was a group of about 30 people hacking on Apache projects with some
minor 56k connectivity to the net. ;-) Tonight there is <a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a> get together at a local pub. Should be fun.

Last week I was at  <a href="http://www.BSDCon.org/">BSDCon</a>, which was a lot of fun as well. <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/fanf/">fanf</a> went up for only a day or two, just to kick it with us and to have some beers and visit a few sessions.
