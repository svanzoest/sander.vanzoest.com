These last few months have been very exciting and thought provoking. After working on many interesting and challenging problems to create an ecosystem of content, software and consumer electronics at <a href="http://www.divx.com/">DivX</a>, I decided it was time to take a break. I have had a fantastic time working with some great folks on the underlying technology that powers a <a href="http://www.divx.com/company/press/press_detail.php?pr_id=98">video on demand service in Italy</a>, a whole new  digital home platform named <a href="http://www.divx.com/company/partner/connected.php">DivX Connected</a> that is designed for portability and low cost embedded devices and building an architectural foundation to enhance productivity and maintainability for the company as a whole. It was a great experience and I would like to thank <a href="http://www.divx.com/company/about/bio.php?bio=jordan">Jordan Greenhall</a> for his trust in me and the opportunity to contribute to DivX.

I  wanted to spend some time at home with the family. Doing this has been one of the best things I could have done. It clearly has created a much closer bond with my daughter and I have been able to catch some key accomplishments of her.
It was uncertain for me as to how long I would be spending at home, but as soon as people found out I was spending time at home, I got a lot of inquiries, proposals and offers for new positions all around the world. The time off also allowed me to catch up with a lot of friends and old co-workers which was very needed as well. 
</p>
<p>
There were a lot of events, such as DivX going public on NASDAQ and the Google/Youtube deal, that brought even more inquiries about when or if I would join another company again or if I would be interested in joining the founding team of some media startup, etc. All this buzz, did get me thinking about what I was going to do when I wanted to join the work force again. I contemplated on starting something on my own and spend a few years doing research. All of this opened a lot of doors and gave me an opportunity to keep my brain thinking about the online media space while spending time at home with the family.

<p>
After dozens of discussions with some outstanding teams and organizations, I decided to take on a Director of Operations role at a stealth media startup created by proven entrepreneurs who had put together a world class team of whom a few I had already worked with at previous companies or met through my involvement with Open Source. So, far I am really liking what I am seeing and applaud all the effort of the team that has put together what exists right now. It is truly amazing that this got put together in couple of months.

The company has been very quiet, although, recently has started to come more out of hiding and has said we can now talk more publicly about our jobs and the company we work for.  Right now, the organization is publicly known as <a href="http://www.theveniceproject.com/">The Venice Project</a>, but it will be re-branded at some point in the future when we are out of beta. If you are interested in what we are doing check out the <a href="http://www.theveniceproject.com/blog.html">company blog</a> or sign up for a <a href="http://www.theveniceproject.com/apply.html">beta test account</a>.

So, here starts another chapter in life. As I have come to realize, change teaches you a lot of things about what you had and what you have been missing out on. I am looking forward to learning more about both.
