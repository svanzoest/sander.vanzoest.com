After a <a HREF="http://messages.yahoo.com/bbs?.mm=FN&amp;action=m&amp;board=21750689&amp;tid=mppp&amp;sid=21750689&amp;mid=1
0472">pointer</a> about an <a HREF="http://www.latimes.com/class/employ/showbiz/20000616/t000056987.html">L.A. Times article</a>, I notice different numbers in regards to the settlements. 1/3 cent per stream of a song and 1 1/2 cents per addition to my.mp3.com per song doesn't sound too bad. If they had to pay the 1 1/2 cents per stream as the NY Times article seemed to claim it would have been a lot worse. 

Anyways, I have been spending some time getting my servers sorted out and watched the netherlands play soccer against denmark which was entertaining. Time to get some sleep before saturday morning hits.
