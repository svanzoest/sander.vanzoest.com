<h3>Busy</h3>
<p>
I have been very busy these last few weeks working on setting up moderation on the <a href="http://www.SDGoth.org/">SDGoth</a> site and getting into the way of doing things at the new job. So far it has been a mixture of silly boring stuff, mixed with understanding the current architecture and getting a grip on the wealth of information and software available at HQ. I feel pretty confident about things though and have a good idea on how to proceed from here. Everyone has been really great to work with from the start, which is always somewhat surprising.

<h3>Ezmlm</h3>
<p>
Setting up Ezmlm to a complex setup as I have now, was kind of a pain. I mean, if you install it out of the box with the right flags it isn't hard. But once you start tweaking things. You can easily get caught up in the details and forget something minor that causes the whole thing to fail.  I guess this is where the unix philosophy of small programs with specific functions that make the entire application breaks down. It breaks down when you get lost in the details and don't remember what went where.

<h3>Gibson's MaGIC</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.gibsonmagic.com/">This</a> is definately one of the most interesting things coming from the <a href="http://www.aes.org/">AES Show</a>.  Granted it has been in the works for a while, but it seems to be getting pretty good. Now, I haven't looked into it much, but although it uses RJ-45, I am not certain it will actually work along side a normal ethernet IP network. If it does that would be great, it would provide a dual purpose for the wire I am stringing around. Now if it could deal with 802.11 wireless as well, that would be even better. This isn't exactly MIDIoIP as provided by <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~lazzaro/sa/">sfront</a>, but communicating Sysex and MIDI control messages over TCP/IP would be pretty cool. I guess RJ-45 is nice, but TCP/IP would be even better. RTP and SIP might be able to help here. Hmm.. Ah, too many cool toys to play with and that is besides the creation of music.

<h3>How much of your disk space do <i>they</i> own?</h3>
<p>
I am starting to see this more and more, and I am wondering how far this will go. We all know that in browser cache we sometimes store things that we did not necessarily want. Such as banner ads, pop-ups, cookies and other tracking and control data from online services. But what happens when these things get thrown about your normal applications and download data?
</p>
<p>
We are starting to see a lot of <i>bundling</i> of applications and <i>pre-caching</i> of content. They can be <i>bonus</i> apps or shareware that you might be interested in or just something that will hide in your windows registry, so you won't be able to adjust your settings later, or provide you with a pretty blue of death. Or what if they are <i>pre-caching</i> content that they <i>assume</i> you would be interested in? such as the rest of an album, although you only asked for the 3rd track you like so much. How would you know what you could delete and what you can not? The invasion of disk space, by people assuming to know what <i>you</i> want.
</p>
<p>
Now it gets even more fun with DRM and lets say PressPlay content. When I no longer use the service, will I be able to remove all the unwanted propaganda and delete all the now useless songs? Maybe I am caching content for my neighbor, because they threw us in some P2P network, I wasn't aware of. So there goes a good 2 percent of my disk space, for what? I ask you.  I am already having a lot of issues with software I install myself (including Operating Systems), let stand some rogue P2P network. I can see it now.  Spammers are going to take over my disk space, because they made my machine an open SMTP relay when I installed the latest screensaver.
