I probably should have said this earlier, but I have officially resigned from MP3.com, Inc and I now am in the process of getting my home office in shape. I am not exactly sure what I am going to do, but I am entertaining many offers and even have thought about starting up my own gig. This should give me some time to work on  some open source projects. :-) I will keep you posted.
