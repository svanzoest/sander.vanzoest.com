I finally got connectivity at home again. This will allow me to spend more time online, but I still need to spend a decent amount of time cleaning up the home office. An <a HREF="http://www.inside.com/story/Story_Cached/0,2770,5663,00.html">interesting article</a> appeared on Inside today. It will be interesting to see if this rumor will come true.
