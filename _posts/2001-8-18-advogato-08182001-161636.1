        <p><b><a href="/person/tunesmith/">tunesmith</a></b>: Glad to hear
you found pho. It has been an interesting 
list for a while but now that most online 
music startups have gone 
bust it has been mostly noise with the
occasional worthwhile post. People are 
trying to figure out where to go to next and 
waiting to see where things like MusicNet 
and Duet end up. Hopefully it will get 
better 
again once the momentum starts going again.

After my last diary incident at the office things have
had been nothing but political and a strive to make as 
much money with as little effort as possible. It mainly 
has been an exhibition of power by upper and middle 
management which really didn't sit right in my 
stomach.  So last thursday I send in my letter of 
resignation after I concluded it wouldn't get any better.
This was confirmed by getting a reply to my resignation 
from the CEO containing the single word &quot;Boring&quot;. It is 
really a shame because the place had soo much 
potential and had a very talented group. Oh well, now 
it  is time to locate the next great thing I believe in to 
contribute to. If you know of anything that might be of 
interest, feel free to contact me.

        <p> I have been spending a lot of time these last few days 
in my Studio work on a new track. On top of recording 
some mixes of my favorite records to come out in the 
last year or so. It has be quite productive and has
 allowed me to get away from life for a little while. With
all this emotion and energy being replanted, I actually 
feel that the new track and mix are looking to be some 
of the best work done todate.

After seeing Anthony Pappa at DNA Lounge a few 
weeks ago, I went to go see Cass dee-jay
at <a href="http://www.spundaehollywood.com/">
Spundae @ Circus</a>. He played a magnificant 
set which was nice, energetic and dark. Probably
the best set I have been to this year. Tonight I am
going to see if I can see
<a href="http://www.satoshitomiie.com/">Satoshi 
Tomiie</a> and Scott Bond play at 
<a href="http://www.giantclub.com/">Giant</a> or I 
might swing by Spundae againto see Lee Burridge 
on the decks.

I spend a few hours last night reading the 
<a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> 
protocol spec 
and playing with the server and clients. From my 
experience using 
<a href="http://www.gale.org/">Gale</a>
and comercial IM systems, I must say that Jabber has 
a lot of potential. I  am going to see if I can write some 
code against it to get a better idea of how it works in 
practice. Maybe looking into a gale - jabber gateway 
could be interesting.

There are plenty of things to do. It is now a matter of 
figuring out what would be the best thing for me to 
focus on.
