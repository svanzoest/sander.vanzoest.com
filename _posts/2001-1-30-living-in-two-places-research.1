<i>Happy New Year!</i> It has been almost 4 months since my last confes^H^H^H^H^H^Hentry. The last few months have been busy and somewhat stressful. Trying to figure out how I want my personal life to continue. What color to dye my hair next? etc.  Trying to keep a personal life in two places at the same time is
very difficult and very hard. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, it is almost like choosing between fun work with great people and a personal life outside of work.. I really wish that I could be in two places at the same time.

I haven't really written a lot of code lately. I have been spending most of my time doing research on different technologies and trying to get a better understanding of the space. Some of the work is somewhat familiar to me, but it is kinda scary to see how
much has changed in just a few weeks. Although it has been very educational and enjoyable to be able to spend some time getting the hang of new technologies such as attending the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">49th IETF</a>. I will be happy to back in the code. I have written a few proposals for different conferences so we will see if those stirred up any interest. Now lets hope the coding doesn't involve too much crunch time when it does become time.

I have been a music fanatic for a long time and spend a fair time playing keys, I have recently picked up moving into upgrading some of my DJ gear. I picked up a pair of legendary <a href="http://www.panasonic.com/consumer_electronics/technics_audio/turntables.htm">SL-1200MK2s</a> to suplement my <a href="http://www.pioneerprodj.com/">CMX-5k</a> and got a new <a href="http://www.pioneerprodj.com/">DJM-600 Mixer</a>. I really love the new set up. It is very scalable and flexable, now only if I could find the time to play with it more and get good enough to creatively mix some of my more obscure musical desires for the harder edge. Maybe one of these days I will feel more comfortable to give
you all a taste.
