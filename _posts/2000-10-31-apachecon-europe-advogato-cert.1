<b>ApacheCon 2000 Europe</b>

Back from <a href="http://www.ApacheCon.com/2000/EU/">ApacheCon
Europe</a>. It was pretty good. I met a lot of people I had never met face to face before, and overall got a better vibe of things and where things are going in the future. Talked with the author of <a href="http://www.axkit.org/">AxKit</a> Matt
Sergeant, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/gstein/">gstein</a>, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/rbb/">rbb</a>,
<a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/sterling/">sterling</a>, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/wrowe/">wrowe</a>,
<a href="http:/www.advogato.org/person/daniel/">daniel</a>, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/Jick/">Jick</a> and many others. I finally lived up to my reputation by attending the conference with greenish blue hair. Needless to say <a href="http://www.oraclehumor.com/Humor/MontyPython.html">there
was much rejoicing</a> with english ales and bitters.

 <b>Back to work</b>

Now that I am back I am updating and working some more on
the <a href="http://archive.covalent.net/">Apache Mailing List
Archives</a>, yes <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/wrowe/">wrowe</a>, search is still one of the things I am working on. ;-) But better support for different charsets is also a thing I am working on with some of the better support in the CVS versions of AxKit.

<b>Advogato Certification</b>

Another comment on <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/wrowe/">wrowe</a> diary, I must say that I am actually quite happy with being a Journeyer, since I really do not feel that I have contributed enough to Open Source to qualify as a master. There are a lot of things I would like to see and things I would like to do better, the archive being one, and hopefully we will get to a point where I might feel I might deserve the
certification.
