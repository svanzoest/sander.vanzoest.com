<h1><a name="why"></a>1. Why serve Audio on the Net?</h1>
<p>
This is almost like asking, why are you reading this? it might be
because of the excitement caused by the new media that has recently
crazed upon the internet. People are looking to bring their lifes onto
the net, one of the things that brings that closer to a reality is the
ability to hear live broadcasts of the worlds news, favorite sport; 
hear music and to teleconference with others. Sometimes it is simply
to enhance the mood to a web site or to provide audio feedback of
actions performed by the visitor of the web site.
</p>
<h1><a name="difference"></a>2. What makes delivering audio so different?</h1>
<p>
The biggest reason to what makes audio different then traditional
web media such as graphics, text and HTML is the fact that timing
is very important. This caused by the significant increase in size
of the media and the different quality levels that exist.
</p>
<p>
There really are two kinds of goals behind audio streams.
In one case there is a need for immediate response the moment
playback is requested and this can sacrifice quality. While
in the other case quality and a non-interrupted stream are much
more important.
</p>
<p>
This sort of timing is not really required of any other media,
with the exception of video. In the case of HTML and images the
files sizes are usually a lot smaller which causes the objects
to load much quicker and usually are not very useful without
having the entire file. In audio the middle of a stream can have
useful information and still set a particular mood.
</p>
<h1><a name="ways"></a>3. Different ways of delivery Audio on the Net.</h1>
<h2>Embedding audio in your Web Page</h2>
<p>
This used to be a lot more common in the past. Just like embedding
an image in a web page, it is possible to add a sound clip or score
to the web page.
</p>
<p>
The linked in audio files are usually short and of low quality to 
avoid a long delay for downloading the rest of the web page and the
audio format needs to be supported by the browser natively or with
a browser plug-in to avoid annoying the visitor.
</p>
<p>
This can be accomplished using the HTML 4.0 [<a href="#html4">HTML4</a>] object element which
works similar to how to specify an applet with the object element.
In the past this could also be accomplished using the embed and bgsound
browser specific additions to HTML.
</p>
<h3 class="example">Example</h3>
<pre class="code">
 &lt;object type="audio/x-midi" data="../media/sound.mid" width="200" height="26"&gt;
    &lt;param name="src" value="../media/sound.mid&gt;
    &lt;param name="autostart" value="true"&gt;
    &lt;param name="controls" value="ControlPanel"&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Each param element is specific to each browser. Please check with each
browser for specific information in regards to what param elements are
available.
</p>
<p>
In this method of delivering audio the audio file is served up via the
web server. When using an Apache HTTPD server make sure that the appropriate
mime type is configured for the audio file and that the audio file is
named and referenced by the appropriate extension.
</p>
<p>
Although the current HTML 4.01 [<a href="#html4">HTML4</a>] says to use the object element
many browsers out on the market today still look for the embed element.
Below find a little snippet that will work work in many browsers.
</p>
<pre class="code">
&lt;object type="audio/x-midi" data="../media/sound.mid" width="200" height="26"&gt;
&lt;param name="src" value="../media/sound.mid"&gt;
&lt;param name="autostart" value="true"&gt;
&lt;param name="controls" value="ControlPanel"&gt;

&lt;embed type="audio/x-midi" src="../media/sound.mid"
     width="200" height="26" autoplay="true" controls="ControlPanel"&gt;
    &lt;noembed&gt;Your browser does not support embedded MIDI files.&lt;/noembed&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
</pre>
<p>
With the increasing installation base of the Flash browser plug-in by
Macromedia most developers that are looking to provide this kind of
functionality to a web page are creating flash elements that have their
own way of adding audio that is discussed in Flash specific documents.
</p>
<h2>Downloading via HTTP</h2>
<p>
Using this method the visitor to the website will have to download the
entire audio file and save it to the hard drive before it can be
listened to. (1) This is very popular with people that want to listen 
to high quality streams of audio and have a 64 Kbps or below connection to
the internet. In some cases where the demand for a stream is high or
the internet is congested downloading the content even for high bandwidth
users can be affective and useful.
</p>
<p>
One of the advantages of downloading audio to the local computer hard
drive is that it can be played back (once downloaded) any time as long
as the audio file is accessable from the computer.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of sites on the internet that provide this functionality
for music and other audio files. It is also one of the easiest ways to
delivery high quality audio to visitors.
</p>
<dl> 
<dd>
 (1) Microsoft Windows Media Player in conjunction with the Microsoft
     Internet Explorer Browser will automaticly start playing the 
     audio stream after a sufficient amount of the file has been 
     downloaded. This can be accomplished because of the tight 
     integration of the Browser and Media Player. With most audio players
     you can listen to a file being downloaded, but you will have to
     invoke the action manually.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>On-Demand streaming via HTTP</h2>
<p>
The real difference between downloading and on-demand streaming is
that in on-demand streaming the audio starts playing before the entire
audio file has been downloaded. This is accomplished by a hand of off
the browser to the audio player via an intermediate file format that
has been configured by the browser to be handled by the audio player.
</p>
<p>
Look in a further section entitled "Linking to Audio via Apache HTTPD"
below for more information about the different intermediate file formats.
</p>
<p>
This type of streaming is very popular among the open source crowd and
is the most widely implemented using the MP3 file format. Apache,
Shoutcast [<a href="#shoutcast">SHOUTCAST</a>] and Icecast [<a href="#icecast">ICECAST</a>] are the most common 
software components used to provide on-demand streaming via HTTP. Both
Icecast and Shoutcast are not fully HTTP compliant, but Icecast is 
becoming closer. For more information about the Shoutcast and Icecast 
differences see the section below.
</p>
<p>
Sites like Live365.com and MP3.com are huge sites that rely on this
method of delivery of audio.
</p>
<h2>On-Demand Streaming via RTSP/RTP</h2>
<p>
RTSP/RTP is a new set of streaming protocols that is getting more 
backing and becoming more popular by the second. The specification
was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force Working Groups
AVT [<a href="#ietfavt">IETFAVT</a>] and MMUSIC [<a href="#ietfmmusic">IETFMMUSIC</a>]. RTP the Realtime Transfer
Protocol has been around longer then RTSP and originally came out
of the work towards a better teleconferencing, mbone, type system.
RTSP is the Real-Time Streaming Protocol that is used as a control
protocol and acts similarily to HTTP except that it maintains state
and is bi-directional.
</p>
<p>
Currently the latest Real Networks Streaming Servers support RTSP
and RTP and Real Networks own proprietary transfer protocol RDT.
Apple's Darwin Streaming server is also RTSP/RTP compliant.
</p>
<p>
The RTSP/RTP protocol suite is very powerful and flexable in regards
to most streaming needs. It has the ability to suport "server-push"
style stream redirects and has the ability to throttle streams to
ensure the stream can sustain the limited bandwidth over the network.
</p>
<p>
For On-Demand streams the RTP protocol would usually stream over
UDP and have a TCP connection open for RTSP. Because of the
rich features provided by the protocol suite, it is not very well
suited to allow people to download the stream and therefore the
download via HTTP method might still be prefered by some.
</p>
<h2>Live Broadcast Streaming via RTSP/RTP</h2>
<p>
In the case of a live broadcast streaming RTSP/RTP shines. RTP allowing
for UDP datagrams to be transmitted to clients allows for fast immediate
delivery of content with the sacrifice of reliability. The RTP stream
can be send over IP Multicast to minimize bandwidth on the network.
</p>
<p>
Many Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are starting to provide support for
RTSP/RTP proxies that should provide a better quality streaming environment
on the internet. 
</p>
<p>
Much work is also being done in the RTP space to provide transfers over 
telecommunication networks such as cellular phones. Although not directly
related, per se, it does provide a positive feeling knowing that all the
audio related transfer groups seem to be working towards a common standard
such as RTP.
</p>
<h2>On-Demand or Live Broadcast streaming via MMS.</h2>
<p>
This is the Microsoft Windows Media Technologies Streaming protocol. It
is only supported by Microsoft Windows Media Player and currently only
works on Microsoft Windows.
</p>
<h1><a name="mimetypes"></a>4. Configuring Mime Types</h1>
<p>
One of the most hardest things in serving audio has been the wide variety
of audio codecs and mime types available. The battle of mime types on the
audio player side of things isn't over, but it seems to be a little more
controlled.
</p>
<p>
On the server side of things provide the appropriate mime type for the 
particular audio streams and/or files that are being served to the audio 
players. Although some clients and operating systems handle files fully 
based on the file extension. The mime type [<a href="#rfc2045">RFC2045</a>] is more specific 
and more defined.
</p>
<p>
The registered mime types are maintained by <abbr title="Internet Assigned Numbers Authority">IANA</abbr> [<a href="#iana">IANA</a>]. On their site
they have a list of all the registered mime types and their name space.
</p>
<p>
If you are planning on using a mime type that isn't registered by IANA
then signal this in the name space by adding a "x-" before the subtype. 
Because this was not done very often in the audio space, there was a 
lot of confusion to what the real mime type should be.
</p>
<p>
For example the MPEG 1.0 Layer 3 Audio (MP3) [<a href="#oramp3book">ORAMP3BOOK</a>] mime type 
was not specified for the longest time. Because of this the mime type 
was <code>audio/x-mpeg</code>. Although none of the audio players understood 
<code>audio/x-mpeg</code>, but understood <code>audio/mpeg</code> it was not a technically 
correct mime type. Later audio players recognized this and started 
using the <code>audio/x-mpeg</code> mime type. Which in the end caused a lot 
of hassles with clients needing to be configured differently depending
on the website and client that was used. Last november we thanked
Martin Nilsson of the ID3 tagging project for registering <code>audo/mpeg</code>
with IANA. [<a href="#rfc3003">RFC3003</a>]
</p>
<p>
Correct configuration of Mime Types is very important. Apache HTTPD
ships with a fairly up to date copy of the mime.types file, so most
of the default ones (including <code>audio/mpeg</code>) are there.
</p>
<p>
But in case you run into some that are not defined use the <code>mod_mime.c</code>
directives such as <code>AddType</code> to fix this.
</p>
<h2 class="example">Examples</h2>
<pre class="code">
	AddType audio/x-mpegurl .m3u
	AddType audio/x-scpls   .pls
	AddType application/x-ogg .ogg
</pre>
<h1><a name="fileformats"></a>5. Common Audio File Formats</h1>
<p>
There are many audio formats and metadata formats that exist. Many of
them do not have registered mime types and are hardly documented.
This section is an attempt at providing the most accurate mime type
information for each format with a rough description of what the files
are used for.
</p>
<h2>Real Audio</h2>
<p> 
Real Networks Proprietary audio format and meta formats. This is one
of the more common streaming audio formats today. It comes in several
sub flavors such as Real 5.0, Real G2 and Real 8.0 etc. The file size
varies depending on the bitrates and what combination of bitrates are
contained within the single file.
The following mime types are used
</p>
<pre class="code">
	audio/x-pn-realaudio .ra, .ram, .rm
	audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin .rpm
	application/x-pn-realmedia
</pre>
<h2>MPEG 1.0 Layer 3 Audio (MP3)</h2>
<p>
This is currently one of the most popular downloaded audio formats
that was originally developed by the Motion Pictures Experts Group
and has patents by the Fraunhofer IIS Institute and Thompson 
Multimedia. [<a href="#oramp3book">ORAMP3BOOK</a>] The file is a lossy compression that at
a bitrate of 128kbps reduces the file size to roughly a MB/minute.
The mime type is <code>audio/mpeg</code> with the extension of <code>.mp3</code> [<a href="#rfc3003">RFC3003</a>]
</p>
<h2>Windows Media Audio</h2>
<p> 
Originally known as MS Audio was developed by Microsoft as the MP3
killer. Still relatively a new format but heavily marketed by
and becoming more popular by the minute. It is a successor
to the Microsoft Audio Streaming Format (ASF). The commonly used
mime type is <code>audio/x-ms-wma</code> with the extension of <code>.wma</code>
</p>
<h2>WAV</h2>
<p>
Windows Audio Format is a pretty semi-complicated encapsulating 
format that in the most common case is PCM with a WAV header up front.
It has the mime type <code>audio/x-wav</code> with the extension <code>.wav</code>.
</p>
<h2>Vorbis</h2>
<p>
Ogg Vorbis [<a href="#vorbis">VORBIS</a>] is still a relatively new format brought to 
life by CD Paranoia author Christopher Montgomery; known to the 
world as Monty. It is an open source audio format free of patents 
and gotchas. It is a codec/file format that is roughly as good as
the MP3 format, if not much better. The mime type for Ogg Vorbis is
<code>application/x-ogg</code> with the extension of <code>.ogg</code>.
</p>
<h2>MIDI</h2>
<p>
The MIDI standard and file format [<a href="#midispec">MIDISPEC</a>] have been used by 
Musicians for a long time. It is a great format to add music to
a website without the long download times and needing special players
or plug-ins. The mime type is <code>audio/x-midi</code> and the extension is <code>.mid</code>
</p>
<h2>Shockwave Flash (ADPCM/MP3)</h2>
<p>
Macromedia Flash [<a href="#flashaudio">FLASHAUDIO</a>] uses its own internal audio format
that is often used on Flash websites. It is based on Adaptive 
Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM) and the MP3 file format.
Because it is usually used from within Flash it usually isn't served
up seperatedly but it's extension is <code>.swf</code>
</p>
<p>
There are many many many more audio codecs and file formats that exist.
I have listed a few that won't be discussed but should be kept in mind.
Formats such as PCM/Raw Audio (<code>audio/basic</code>), MOD, MIDI (<code>audio/x-midi</code>),
QDesign (used by Quicktime), Beatnik, Sun's AU, Apple/SGI's AIFF, AAC
by the MPEG Group, Liquid Audio and AT&amp;T's a2b (AAC derivatives),
Dolby AC-3, Yamaha's TwinVQ (originally by Nippon Telephone and Telegraph)
and MPEG-4 audio.
</p>
<h1><a name="linking"></a>6. Linking to Audio via Apache HTTPD</h1>
<p>
There are many different ways to link to audio from the Apache HTTPD
web server. It seems as if every codec has their own metafile format.
The metafile format is provided to allow the browser to hand off the
job of requesting the audio file to the audio player, because it is
more familiar with the file format and how to handle streaming or how
to actually connect to the audio server then the web browser is.
</p>
<p>
This section will discuss the more common methods to provide streaming
links to provide that gateway from the web to the audio world.
</p>
<p>
Probably the one that is the most recognized file is the RAM file.
</p>
<h2>RAM</h2>
<p>
Real Audio Metafile. It is a pretty straight forward way that Real
Networks allowed their Real Player to take more control over their
proprietary audio streams. The file format is simply a URL on each
line that will be streamed in order by the client. The mime type
is the same as other RealAudio files <code>audio/x-pn-realaudio</code> where
the pn stands for Progressive Networks the old name of the company.
</p>
<h3 class="example">Example</h3>
<pre class="code">
http://www.example.com/audio/file1.ra
http://www.example.com/audio/file2.ra
C:\audio\file1.ra
</pre>
<h2>PLS</h2>
<p> 
This is the playlist files used by Nullsoft's Winamp MP3 Player. Later
on it got more widely used by Nullsoft's Shoutcast and has the mime
type of <code>audio/x-scpls</code> with the extension <code>.pls</code>. Before shoutcast the
mimetype was simply <code>audio/x-pls</code>. As you can see in the example 
below it looks very much like a standard windows INI file format. 
The <code>Length&lt;number&gt;</code> value can be either <code>-1</code> for 
a continues live broadcast or the length of the track in seconds.
</p>
<h3 class="example">Example</h3>
<pre class="code">
[playlist]
numberofentries=2
File1=http://www.example.com/audio/talk.mp3
Title1=ApacheCon 2002: Audio and Apache
Length1=-1
File2=http://www.example.com/audio/break.mp3
Title2=Break Between Sessions
Length2=900
</pre>
<h2>M3U</h2>
<p> 
This next one is the MPEG Layer 3 URL Metafile that has been around
for a very long time as a playlist format for MP3 players. It supported
URLs pretty early on by some players and got the mime type 
<code>audio/x-mpegurl</code> and is now used by Icecast and many destination sites
such as MP3.com. The format is exactly the same as that of the RAM
file, just a list of urls that are seperated by line feeds.
</p>
<h3 class="example">Example</h3>
<pre class="code">
http://www.example.com/audio/file1.mp3
http://www.example.com/audio/file2.mp3
C:\audio\file1.mp3
</pre>
<p>
Certain MP3 players found the simple M3U format limiting and have added
additional capabilities. Most of these capabilities, were already present
in the PLS format and therefore have limited support over all.
The ability to add comments has been added. Comments in M3U start with
a <code>#</code> symbol and will be ignored by most players. Within
the comments special tags such as <code>EXTM3U</code>, <code>EXTINF</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>EXTM3U</code> signifies to the MP3 player that this M3U file has additional
information. This extended data is provided before each URI with the
<code>EXTINF:</code> tag.
</p>
<h3 class="example">Example</h3>
<pre class="code">
#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1,ApacheCon 2002: Audio and Apache 
http://www.example.com/audio/talk.mp3
#EXTINF:900,Break Between Sessions
http://www.example.com/audio/break.mp3
</pre>
<h2>SDP</h2>
<p> 
This is the Session Description Protocol [<a href="#rfc2327">RFC2327</a>] which is heavily
used within RTSP and is a standard way of describing how to subscribe
to a particular RTP stream. The mime type is <code>application/sdp</code> with the
extension <code>.sdp</code>. 
</p>
<h3 class="example">Example</h3>
<pre class="code">
v=0	
a=control:rtsp://stream.example.com/

s=ApacheCon 2002: Audio and Apache
</pre>
<p>
Sometimes you might see RTSL (Real-Time Streaming Language) floating 
around. This was an old Real Networks format that has been superseeded 
by SDP. It's mimetype was <code>application/x-rtsl</code> with the extension of <code>.rtsl</code>
</p> 
<h2>ASX</h2>
<p> 
Is a Windows Media Metafile format [<a href="#msasx">MSASX</a>] that is based on early XML
standards. It can be found with many extensions such as <code>.wvx</code>, <code>.wax</code>
and <code>.asx</code>. The mime type is <code>video/x-ms-asf</code>.
</p>
<table>

<h2>SMIL</h2>
<p> 
Is the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language [<a href="#smil20">SMIL20</a>] that
is now a W3C Recommendation [<a href="#w3symm">W3SYMM</a>]. It was originally developed
by Real Networks to provide an HTML-like language to their Real Player
that was more focused on multimedia. The mime type is <code>application/smil</code>
with the extensions of either <code>.smil</code> or <code>.smi</code>
</p>
<h3 class="example">Example</h3>

<h2>MHEG</h2>
<p>
Is a hypermedia language developed by the ISO group. [<a href="#mheg1">MHEG1</a>] [<a href="#mheg5">MHEG5</a>] 
and [<a href="#mheg5cor">MHEG5COR</a>]. It has been adopted by the Digital Audio Visual
Council [<a href="#davic">DAVIC</a>]. It is more used for teleconferencing, broadcasting
and television, but close enough related that it receives a mention
here. The mime type is <code>application/x-mheg</code> with the extension of
<code>.mheg</code>

<h1><a name="config"></a>7. Configuring Apache HTTPD specificly to serve large Audio Files</h1>
<p>
Some of the most common things that you will need to adjust to be
able to serve many large audio files via the Apache HTTPD Server.
Because of the difference in size between HTML files and Audio files,
the <code>MaxClients</code> will need to be adjusted appropriatedly depending on
the amount of time listeners end up tieing up a process. If you are
serving high quality MP3 files at 128kbps for example you should
expect more then 5 minute download times for most people.
</p>
<p>
This will significantly impact your webserver since this means that
that process is occupied for the entire time. Because of this you
will also want to in crease the <code>TimeOut</code> Directive to a higher 
number. This is to ensure that connections do not get disconnected
half way through a transfer and having that person hit "reload"
and connect again.
</p>
<p>
Because of the amount of time the downloads tie up the processes
of the server, the smallest footprint of the server in memory would
be recommended because that would mean you could run more processes
on the machine.
</p>
<p>
After that normal performance tweaks such as max file descriptor
changes and longer tcp listen queues apply.
</p>
<h1><a name="icecast"></a>8. Icecast/Shoutcast Protocol</h1>
<p>
Both protocols are very tightly based on HTTP/1.0. The main difference
is a group of new headers such as the <code>icy</code>headers by Shoutcast and the
new <code>x-audiocast</code> headers provided by Icecast.
</p>
<p>
A typical shoutcast request from the client.
</p>
<pre class="code">
GET / HTTP/1.0

ICY 200 OK
icy-notice1:&lt;BR&gt;This stream requires &lt;a href="http://www.winamp.com/"&gt;
            Winamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
icy-notice2:SHOUTcast Distributed Network Audio Server/posix v1.0b&lt;BR&gt;
icy-name: Great Songs
icy-genre: Jazz
icy-url: http://shout.serv.dom/
icy-pub: 1
icy-br: 24
  
&lt;data&gt;&lt;songtitle&gt;&lt;data&gt;

</pre>
<p>
The icy headers display the song title and other formation including if
this stream is public and what the bitrate is.
</p>
<p>
A typical icecast request from the client.
</p>
<pre class="code">
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: icecast.serv.dom
x-audiocast-udpport: 6000
Icy-MetaData: 0
Accept: */*

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: Icecast/VERSION
Content-Type: audio/mpeg
x-audiocast-name: Great Songs
x-audiocast-genre: Jazz
x-audiocast-url: http://icecast.serv.dom/
x-audiocast-streamid:
x-audiocast-public: 0
x-audiocast-bitrate: 24
x-audiocast-description: served by Icecast 

&lt;data&gt;

</pre>
<p>
 NOTE: I am mixing the headers of the controlling client with those from
       a listening client. 
</p> 
<p>
The CPAN Perl Package <code>Apache::MP3</code> by Lincoln Stein implements a little of
each which works because MP3 players tend to support both.
</p>
<p>
One of the big differences in implementations between the listening clients 
is that Icecast uses an out of band UDP channel to update metadata
while the Shoutcast server gets it meta data from the client embedded within
the MP3 stream. The general meta data for the stream is set up via the
<code>icy</code> and <code>x-audiocast</code> HTTP headers.
</p>
<p>
Although the MP3 standard documents were written for interrupted communication
it is not very specific on that. So although it doesn't state that there is
anything wrong with embedding garbage between MPEG frames the players that
do not understand it might make a noisy bleep and chirps because of it.
