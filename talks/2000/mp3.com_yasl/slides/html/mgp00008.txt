Overview

Dynamic XML content :


In cases where you would need unique content for each visitor you can 
create the XML on the fly using mod_perl

Instead of using an XMLWriter that writes to a static file, the XML is
provided dynamicly by mod_perl via the XS XMLWriter module that calls
yasl routines to store the XML elements.

The template gets chosen on the fly by using an apache internal_redirect
onto the template file.
