Process :

        GET /example.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: localhost

Using yasl directives in the <directory> or <location> blocks we determine the yasl template to use for this XML content.

Inside the yasl template <yasl:xml "filename.xml"/> states which XML file to use.

mod_yasl parses the template and replaces yasl:value directives with content from the XML file.
