Overview

URI manipulation :


To provide the ability to use a single template for similar XML files

The URI to the web server can be used to determine what content should
be displayed. 

If __DEFAULT__ is passed to <yasl:xml> we use the URI of the request to
determine what XML file to use.

This can be set per <directory> and can be overridden by an actual request
for a template

since not every request would want the exact same style for the entire site.
